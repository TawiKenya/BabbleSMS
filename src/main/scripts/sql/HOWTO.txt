Here we go through the steps to create a MySQL schema with the following details:
Database name: babblesmsdb
Database username: babblesms
Database password: pass


1) Install MySQL 5.6 and above or MariaDB 10 and above on your local machine.
   Install both client and server applications.


2) Create the database user account as follows:

        % mysql -h localhost -u root -p
        Enter password: ******
        mysql> CREATE USER 'babblesms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
        mysql> GRANT ALL ON babblesmsdb.* TO 'babblesms'@'localhost';
        Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)
        mysql> quit
        Bye

    In the commands shown, the % represents the prompt displayed by your shell or
    command interpreter, and mysql> is the prompt displayed by mysql.


3) Create the database as follows:
        % mysql -h localhost -u babblesms -p
        Enter password: ******
        mysql> CREATE DATABASE babblesmsdb;
        Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.09 sec)
        mysql> quit
        Bye


4) Unzip the files


5) Execute the SQL and data import script as follows:
        % mysql -h localhost -u babblesms -p babblesmsdb < tables.mysql.sql
