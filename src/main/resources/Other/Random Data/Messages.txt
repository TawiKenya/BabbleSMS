And now observe how
His soul was full of fire
Assuring you of prompt and careful cooperation
The marvelous beauty of her womanhood
It would be a very remarkable fact
Agitated like a storm-tossed ship
I add a few suggestions
She has an extraordinary gift of conversation
The speaker drew an indignant breath
I was exceedingly interested
An easy prey to the powers of folly
A heart from which noble sentiments sprang like sparks from an anvil
It is pitiable to reflect
A look threatening and peremptory
Pregnant with a lesson of the deepest import
We must insist upon a prompt settlement
Dawn had broken
The mute melancholy landscape
They all met a dark and relentless fate
Let us look nearer home
My thoughts came yapping and growling round me like a pack of curs
You may be sure
Apprehensive solicitude about the future
Reluctantly I admit it
I am so sorry--so very sorry
The lilies were drooping, white, and wan,
A covertly triumphant voice
His gaze seemed full of unconquerable hopefulness
Questioned and tested in the crucible of experience
By a curious perversity of fate
A course of arrogant obstinacy
It will give me pleasure to do it
We note that the time is at hand
The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven
To state the case is to prove it
His nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
I know very well the difference between
It would be ill-advised
The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds
There is no more insidious peril
The long-delayed hour of retribution
Brutal recognition of failure
Everywhere the fragrance of a bountiful earth
Piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon
I have a pleasing and personal duty
Degrading and debasing curiosity
A figure full of decision and dignity
He lived as modestly as a hermit
It will thus be seen
A great source of confusion
A state of scarcely veiled insurrection
Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne
He then pelted them with a torrent of words
There is another class of men
The yellow apples glowed like fire
I can not boast of
The name that cuts into my soul like a knife
Do not imagine
Like the shadow of a great hill that reaches far out over the plain
That is a stroke of good fortune
A vivid and arresting presentation
She disclaimed the weariness that
Grazing through a circulating library
The irony of circumstances
You could taste the nutmed
For the simplest of reasons
Do you know, I envy you that
It is satisfactory to notice
The hurly-burly of events
An inscrutable mystery
I want to say one word more
On a noble and commanding scale
I had a kind of hope
We will be glad to lay before you the fullest details
Do not suppose for a moment
We have great reason to be thankful
A strange mixture of carelessness, generosity, and caprice
And it is not plain
He was inexhaustibly voluble
Utterly and essentially irreverent
As we scan the vague unknown
Jealous and formidable foes
She seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea
If only we go deep enough
I think I can claim a purpose
and as ethereal as the light of a solitary star
In other words
How shall I describe to you
A brilliant and paradoxical talker
We are all more or less susceptible
I am not going to let you evade the question
I suppose it is right to answer
In the first place, we should be all agreed
As stupid as a sheep
Such a doctrine is essentially superficial
I have gone so far as to suggest
She exuded a faint and intoxicating perfume of womanliness,
In alliance with steady clearness of intellect
Are you ready to order your meal, sir?
Youth like a summer morn
A deep and most impressive solemnity
The washing is not dry yet
The agonies of conscious failure
Alone, like a storm-tossed wreck, on this night of the glad New Year
The dawn had whitened in the mist like a dead face
May it not also be advanced
Good! that is at least something
The hills were clad in rose and amethyst
The dullest and most vacant minds
And if any of you should question
You take me quite by surprise
like a sudden burst of sunshine on a cloudy day
I close with this sentiment
He conversed with a colorless fluency
There are endless difficulties
How much better, I say, if
The sinking sun made mellow gold of all the air
He surrendered himself to gloomy thought
Does not the event show
For, be assured of this
A quick flame leaped in his eyes
A lone star lingered
Uneasy sense of impending change
I look hopefully to
We have been told by more than one
Remote as the hidden star
The makeshifts of mediocrity
I fear I cannot help you
They all enjoyed the party
Now is it very plain to you?
They would persuade you to
Speaking with all due respect
It is for this reason
The gloom of the afternoon deepened
Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter
The years vanished like a May snowdrift
It is owing to this truth
Terror filled the more remote chambers of his brain with riot
It is really impressive
Shrivel like paper thrust into a flame
I return, in conclusion, to
Nothing could be clearer
Assume a menacing attitude
Do not misunderstand me
Large, dark, luminous eyes saw everything around them
I find it difficult to utter in words
Precipitate and arbitrary changes
I was extremely perplexed
It is far from me to desire
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance
Thick as wind-blown leaves innumerable
The tender grace of a day that is fled
Is it, then, any wonder
As extinct as the dodo
I embrace with peculiar satisfaction
I only marvel
Feeling humiliated by the avowal
Let us suppose the case to be
There is little truth in
A phantom of the brain
I have throughout highly appreciated
Viewed in its general tenor and substance
My meaning is quite the contrary
I admire the main drift of
That ought to make you a little lenient
I end as I began
Objects of general censure
Instantly she revived like flowers in water
Essay a flight of folly
If I can succeed in describing
The remedy I believe to be
Like splendor-winged moths about a taper
I think there is no better evidence
A variety of enfeebling amendments
It would seem to be a wise decision
But I need hardly assert
And here I reproach
I think I am not the first to utter
A welcome release from besetting difficulties
                                           [warp = lengthwise threads]
Making the ear greedy to remark offense
I am ready to do battle
He spoke the language fluently
The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows
I am tempted further to offer to you
Exact and resolute allegiance
Here, then, I am brought to the consideration
A super-refinement of taste
I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?
An unbecoming vehemence
Unsurpassed in force and fitness
I may take as an instance
We shall all doubtless concede
In the meantime I will commend to you
Versatile and essentially original
It seems now to be generally admitted
She felt so energetic
Thy beauty like a beast it bites
The mere fruit of his distempered imagination
I simply cannot endure it
Making allowances for differences of opinion
Another striking instance
Consumed by a demon of activity
I will first call your attention to
That is a counsel of perfection
Bandied about from mouth to mouth
Serenity beamed from his look
I declare to you
like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot
No one here, I am sure
We very much wish you to examine
Embittered and fanatical agitation
Like the moon in water seen by night
An equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism
And thus we are led on then to further question
I regard it as a tribute
I can not persuade myself
Sickening contrasts and diabolic ironies of life
It is of great importance to show
My experience tells me
Your blood is red like wine
A large, rich, copious human endowment
It parted to a liquid horizon and showed the gray rim of the sea
A soft haze, like a fairy dream, is floating over wood and stream
It is indispensable to have
If still you have further doubt
A marvelous sharpener of the faculties
I gratefully accept
as a cloud dims the waving of golden grain
A glaring example of rapacity            [rapacity = plundering]
The palpitating silence lengthened
It is very ingenious
How sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those
Lend a critical ear
Sheer superfluity of happiness
Join the bricks together neatly
The limbs of the tree came crashing down
She was in an anguish of sharp and penetrating remorse
Our hearts bowed down like violets after rain
We are perfectly willing to make concessions
Agile as a leopard
I will tell you what puzzles me
Some of you can recall the time
You are incorrigible
Destructive as the lightning flash
In tones of genuine admiration
Presented with matchless vigor and courage
Suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness
He glanced at his wristwatch
An implacable foe
Voracious and insatiable appetite
We do not question the reality
I tremble to think
It is one of the queerest freaks of fate
Silence deep as death
I feel some explanation is due
I long to speak a word or two
Like a lily in bloom
He was as steady as a clock
Blunt the finer sensibilities
Full of singular freshness, insight and power
No doubt to most of us
Moved to unaccustomed tears
I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments
This is the radical question
If I may take for granted
Transitory in its nature
Owing to our inability to collect out-standing debts
[aigrette = ornamental tuft of upright plumes]
Any time is suitable
from the depth of some enchanted forest
Animated by noble pride
A series of happy thoughts came to mind
The theory seems at first sight
We particularly want to interest you in a new carpet
Marvelous copiousness of illustration
What unseemly levity on his part
The hill-tops gleam in morning's spring
My life was white as driven snow
There is one story which it is said
Her laugh is like a rainbow-tinted spray
The supernatural prescience of prophecy
Stimulated to profitable industry
A flood of pride rose in him
Though thou be black as night
Surely there can be no question about that
Chilli bean nachos are delicious
Rare candor and flexibility of mind
I have now much pleasure in confirming
Sentences level and straight like a hurled lance
In answering the inquiry
High and undiscouraged hope
We should not, therefore, question
Words like the gossamer film of the summer
Blind leaders of the blind
The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea
She flounders like a huge conger-eel in an ocean of dingy morality
My heart will be as wind fainting in hot grass
Sustained dignity and mellifluous precision
Unearthly in its malignant glee
And then again
Beauteous she looks as a water-lily
The flower of courtesy
The dark hours are swept away like crumbling ashes
A trace of obvious sarcasm
I will, with great pleasure
See with eagle glance through conventionalisms
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
But my allotted time is running away
It was a propitious circumstance    [propitious = auspicious, favorable]
Let us push the inquiry yet further
You can hardly be serious
We assume that you are considering
Oh, you may be as scornful as you like
I wish you success and happiness
Serve the innocent purposes of life
In days to come
You will please not be flippant
I speak the fact when I tell you
Is there any reason in the world
A portent full of possible danger
Nothing beats chocolate
If we sincerely desire
However, because of the special circumstances attached
He saw red
In a great and fruitful way
The stacks of corn in brown array, like tattered wigwams on the plain
One other remark suggests itself
But I do not propose all these things
Predict the gloomiest consequences
I admire your foresight
His agitation increased hourly
rose like a vast empty house through which
She was in an anguish of sharp and penetrating remorse
Constrained by the sober exercise of judgment
Perfectly illustrated and exemplified
Frequently recurring forms of awkwardness
A new trouble was dawning on his thickening mental horizon
Unstable moral equilibrium of boyhood
I could wish that this belief
Reflected each in the other like stars in a lake
Altho I say it to myself
Here then is the key
It is a circumstance of happy augury
If I understand the matter at all
A wordless farewell
The sky was heavily sprinkled with stars
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven
A list of our unread books torments some of us like a list of murders
We regret that we are unable to grant your request
Like a flower her red lips parted
A brave but turbulent aristocracy
I believe I voice the sentiment
I have introduced it to suggest
A painful and disconcerting deformity
Wiser counsels prevailed
This arrangement will help us over the present difficulty
A golden haze of light surrounded them
We may parenthetically note
His voice was like the clap of thunder
You may rely on me absolutely
Finally, it is my most fervent prayer
In a vague and fragmentary way I agree with him
Nor let me forget to add here
More than once have I had to express
We can only bow with awe
It is interesting to note
I shall waste no time in refuting
As sleep falls upon the eyes of a child
The question irresistibly emerged
It is indeed generous of you to suggest it
He never liked to visit the doctor
Knotty and subtle disquisitions      
[disquisitions = formal discourse]
I am not so unreasonable as to tell you
It is fitting
Away then with the notion
The firm body like a slope of snow
It is only a fancy of mine
She affected disdain
Allied by taste and circumstances
Falling away like a speck in space
The expression was keenly intellectual
As we shall see in a few moments
Snug as a bug in a rug
A puissant and brilliant family
[puissant = powerful; mighty]
It is no exaggeration to say
Though bright as silver the meridian beams shine
Perpetual gloom and seclusion of life
Her smile was linked with a sigh
But despite all this
It is a fact well known
A vast sweet silence crept through the trees
like a toad out of fissure in the rock
Gar said the pirate, and Gar again
It is notoriously easy to exaggerate
White as the driven snow
Will you have the kindness to explain?
An air of round-eyed profundity
Ill-bred insolence was his only weapon
Distracted by contending desires
A melancholy monotone beat on one's heart
Degenerated into deadness and formality
Roused to tumultuous activity
The balm of solitary musing
If I may so speak
In solving this difficulty
I wish emphatically to reaffirm
This shadowy and chilling sentiment unaccountably creeps over me
If I can carry you with me
New ambitions pressed upon his fancy
It must create astonishment
Peaches are delicious
murmuring its happiness in its sleep
The show is booked out
I know not in what direction to look
It seems to me that you have a perfect right to do so
I am not undertaking to deliver
I hope I get an inverview
Fumble and stumble in helpless incapacity
The whole truth, naked, cold, and fatal as a patriot's blade
It is curious to observe
And this brings me to the last thing
The pernicious doctrines of skeptics
Excruciating cruelty and injustice
The birds swam the flood of air like tiny ships
Advancing to dignity and honor
When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood
He sighed deeply
An artful and malignant enemy
I can not believe, I will not believe
But do not let us depend
No argument can overwhelm a fact
or the glow of health upon the cheek
The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun
Languid streams that cross softly, slowly,
Beset with external dangers
One thing more will complete this question
That is the most incredible part of it
Like a soul that wavers in the Valley of the Shadow
Something essentially inexpressible
It is simply a coincidence
Unfortunately we are compelled at certain times
Gratifying, I am sure
We shall do everything in our power
Mumble only jargon of dotage
The dawn is singing at the door
Our thoughts wander back
But recollect, I pray you, how
Cruel and baseless calumnies
Eminently proper, I think
Against a sky as clear as sapphire
There is nothing overstated in this description
But I leave this train of thought
Taking a broader view
Again thanking you for the inquiry
Unswerving and unselfish fidelity
But it happens very fortunately
I am under the impression
Quixotically generous about money
I will venture to add
Still further
Like the falling thud of the blade of a murderous ax
Don't forget to smile
The sound is like a noon-day gale
I wish also to declare positively
I am told on authority
His dignity forced him to be silent
Read but your history aright
When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle
He found the silence intolerably irksome
I find it rather monotonous
It is always something vicious
If you don't mind my saying so
A patience worthy of admiration
Every now and then you will find
It's so charming of you to say that
Lulled into a sense of false satisfaction
It would be presumptuous in me
Justifiable in certain exigencies   [exigencies = urgent situations]
Gone like tenants that quit without warning
You do not need to be told
It only remains now to speak
Exquisitely stung by the thought
His chin had too vanishing an aspect
Clenched little hands like rumpled roses, dimpled and dear
Envy crossed her face
I confess I have little sympathy
A series of brief and irritating hopes
Like a stalled horse that breaks loose
I look with encouragement
It is really most callous of you to laugh
We want you to read the booklet carefully
The overpowering force of circumstances and necessity
Like winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance
I made bold to retort
Subordination to the common weal
Acute sensibility coupled with quickness of intellect
We invite your attention to
Thrilled by fresh and indescribable odors
Like an eagle dallying with the wind
Dismal march of death
Here we come to the very crux of
I confess, I find it difficult
Kindly let us know your pleasure concerning
Coherent and continuous trend of thought
A memory like a well-ordered cupboard
I was on the point of asking you
In the suggestion I have made
He was drunk as a skunk
Nor has there been wanting
Shattered like so much glass
That would be very discreditable
We appreciate your patronage very much
And I should in like manner repudiate
We all drank a toast
As fresh and invigorating as a sea-breeze
I again ask
But if you want more evidence
Guilty and baffled antagonists
His eyes had a twinkle
The one central difference between
The hour is at hand
Bowed like a mountain
So far as my observation and experience goes
Supremely and undeniably great
It has ever been my ambition
An almost sepulchral regularity and seclusion
Some have insisted
Switch off the computer and come to bed
Due to historical perspective
The past slowly drifted out of his thought
The unlicensed indulgence of curiosity
We will gladly extend to you similar courtesies whenever we can do so
Now, you will allow me to state
Trouble gathered on his brow
You are quite right in your statement
I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it
We are satisfied regarding your statement
She had a face tempered like steel
Our relations with you have been very pleasant
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
Invincible jealousy and hate
And now I must touch upon one point
For so it generally happens
The warmth and kindness of your reception
Enclosed you will find a circular which will fully explain
I must crave your indulgence
But we may depend upon it
I shall now give you some instances
It was an evening of great silences and spaces, wholly tranquil
No one will accuse me
You have done me a great service
As odious as it is absurd
I do not seek to palliate
A shiver of apprehension crisped her skin
Administering a little deft though veiled castigation
He would fall into the blackest depression
Words were flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead
But never was a grosser wrong
Dictated by an overweening partiality
There is something almost terrifying about it
What I suggest is
The only plea to be offered
I am not prepared to dispute the word
His temper was dark and explosive
The most fallacious of all fallacies
like white flower-petals on still deep water
A graceful readiness and vigor
We have the evidence of this
I have quite changed my opinion about that
Veiled by some equivocation
Urgent warning and admonition
If the experience of the world is worth anything
Now, this is to some extent
A new and overmastering impulse
A short time since
When she died, her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole
Dreaded and detested rival
I ask no greater blessing
Those eyelids folded like a white rose-leaf
But quite contrary to this, you will find
No finer sentence has come down to us
In listening to the kind words
Something that seizes tyrannously upon the soul
As merry as bees in clover
A somewhat sharp and incisive voice
Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness
I am very sure you will believe
I have a right to consider
We hope you will enjoy the soup
I think it my duty to
The first thing that we have to consider
Turn left then take the second on the right
Urbanely plastic and versatile
A cloud like a flag from the sky
Like skeletons, the sycamores uplift their wasted hands
I must suppose, however
Like a summer cloud, youth indeed has crept away
Glorious to contemplate
A certain catholicity of taste        
[catholicity = universality]
Endowed with undreamed-of powers
He was surprised to finally meet her
There is hardly any limit
What I mean is this
One remark I will make
I am resolved not to permit
I am wonderfully well
A permanent and habitual state of mind
It is a consoling reflection
like a spirited boy before the face of inscrutable nature
The silent day perfumed with the hidden flowers
I begin with expressing a sentiment
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
[chanticleer = rooster]
I think we must draw a distinction
He held a large sheaf of letters
There is, however, another opinion
His jaunty mood yielded to sadness
Cold as the white rose waking at daybreak
My heart like a bird doth hover
The spider was swept down the drain
Vitiated by intolerance and shortsightedness
I would rather a thousand times
We are very glad to testify to the merit of
A profound and rather irritating egotist by nature
A queer, uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her
Tinsel glitter of empty titles
It is one of the most natural visions
Greeted with unalloyed satisfaction
He was so pround of his achievement
Vibrant with the surge of human passions
Her lips hardened
I am not at present concerned
A sweet bewilderment of tremulous apprehension    
1
  [tremulous = fearful]
Chivalrous loyalty and high forbearance
I have thus stated the reason
Affecting a tone of gayety
Of course I do not stop here
Pointed out with triumphant malice
I am led to believe
I speak of this to show
We of this generation
He was a tall, dark, saturnine youth, sparing of speech
Elementary principles of right and wrong
He was a tall, dark, silent youth
An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception
Then take the other side of the argument
I frankly apologize to you
O
The air was thick with pollution
Felt her breath upon his cheek like a perfumed air
It was torture of the most exquisite kind
Some prejudice is attached
There is a grain of truth in that, I admit
There was a strange massing and curving of the clouds
I rejoice that events have occurred
Believing, as I do
He admired her kiss-provoking lips
The gloom of winter dwelt on everything
And I speak with reverence
Surely I do not misinterpret
A helpless anger simmered in him
Oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material
I am extremely glad you approve of it
Quite the wisest thing you can do
Do you know what his chief interests are now?
But I resist the temptation
He held his breath in admiring silence
I am glad to answer to the toast
An audacious challenge of ridicule
The weather forecast is promising
In one respect you are quite right
It is ours to bear witness
I will not be content until
May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?
The most servile acquiescence
The preternatural pomposities of the pulpit
They rent the air with shouts and acclamations
Let me here make one remark
Slowly moved off and disappeared
This is so delicious
Her hands are white as the virgin rose that she wore on her wedding day
We are beginning to realize
It is interesting, as a theory
There are few spectacles
                                      [lambent = effortlessly brilliant]
I am sure, at any rate
The fluttering of untried wings
A hint of death in the icy breath of the gale
So far as I know
By the common judgment of the thinking world
Now memory and emotion surged in my soul like a tempest
Her voice was rich and vibrant, like the middle notes of a 'cello
In accents of menace and wrath
Dig the hole and build the sandcastle
The woods were silent with adoration
When you are assured
K
Coarse and glittering ostentation
I have frequently been surprised at
The golden sunlight of a great summer day
The victorious assertion of personality
Blithe with the bliss of the morning
Lay hold of the affections
I think I need not say more
His face burnt like a brand
For, in truth, if you please to recollect
I now reiterate
There are several reasons why
You're very good, I'm sure
Again, we have abundant instances
A thousand unutterable fears bore irresistible despotism over her thoughts
This is an astonishing announcement
Some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain
I hope it is no disparagement
Join us, please, when you have time
I think it observable
What are the precise characteristics
And that gave another distorted view
It was disgusting
I shall endeavor to be guided
Weighty as these conditions are
We urge that you write to us by early mail
The allurements of a coquette
Your request is granted before it is made
The sea-wind buffeted their faces
My mind swayed idly like a water-lily in a lake
Unfortunately it is a truth
No one, I think, can fail to observe
like long sad vapors through the twilight sky
Like the tattered effigy in a cornfield
But I propose to speak to you
A sane philosophy of life
He behaved like a child
and goes at a gallop through the plain
Had my limits allowed it
Hence arises a grave mischief
I think you may well rejoice in
I am quite ready to be convinced
Maintained with ingenuity and vigor
I intend to propose
Stamped with unutterable and solemn woe
This is so ironic
I watched you with admiration
Molded by the austere hand of adversity
In further proof of my assertion
The vacant fields looked blankly irresponsive
Foreshadowing summer's end
You may well be proud
They die like flies
The monk's face whitened like sea-foam
It is still an open question
I need not follow out the application
Then again, in corroboration
If we accept at all the argument
He gave her a baffled stare
Doomed by inexorable fate
Now comes the question
The incursions of a venomous rabble
A mere figment of a poet's fancy
We hold fast to the principle
I shall therefore endeavor
Spur and whip the tired mind into action
I beg leave to make some observations
I confess that it is a comfort to me
The dreamy solicitations of indescribable afterthoughts
A somewhat melancholy indolence
I must speak plainly
I heartily congratulate you
It is a pleasing peculiarity
I think we shall all recognize
I say it in all modesty
I can not better sum up
I now pass to the question of
A habit of rigorous definition
As quiet as a nun breathless with adoration
Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity
A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
The caressing peace of bright soft sunshine
In this connection, I may be permitted to refer
I can not give you a better illustration
This I consider to be my own case
Love had like the canker-worm consumed her early prime
Perhaps you think me ungrateful
Through the distortions of prejudice
An idle and unworthy action
There are some who are fond of looking at
An arid dictum
The glow of the ambitious fire
The church swarmed like a hive
You must have misunderstood me
Curious as a lynx
Loose and otiose statement       [otiose = lazy; indolent; of no use]
I have the confident hope
Religious rights and ceremonies
He lay as straight as a mummy
Don't leave it to the imagination
breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight
I will not pause to maintain
It seems to me the primary foundation
The jostling and ugliness of life
Some flash of witty irrelevance
I am reluctant to do that
              [egregious = conspicuously and outrageously reprehensible]
Quick is better than slow
A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses
I would that my voice could reach the ear
His thoughts galloped
Like a rose embower'd in its own green leaves
He sat down quaking like a jelly
Discreditable and insincere support
I have not been able to deny
Scorning such paltry devices
                                           [baulked = checked, thwarted]
It will appear from what has been said
He used an unguarded adjective
Sunbeams flashing on the face of things
I have no pretention to be regarded
Differ in degree only and not in kind
You have often pondered over
I entertain the hope and opinion
An ominous lull and silence
Like a snow-flake lost in the ocean
Evanescent shades of feeling        [evanescent = vanishing like vapor]
I am not here to defend
Subjected to the grossest cruelties
I can hardly agree with you there
He explored the labyrinth of obscure streets
In seasons of difficulty and trial
Illuminate with sinister effect
Such is the lesson which I am taught
Latent vein of whimsical humor
So elusive that the memory of it afterwards
But let none of you think
I must try to describe to you
Then I have your permission?
In this breathless chase of pleasure
Your locks are like the raven
He saw no sign of trickery
An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?
I am not advocating
                                   [approbation = warm approval; praise]
A long tangle of unavoidable detail
I am, my dear sir, yours faithfully
The dictates of plain reason
She sat eyeing him with frosty calm
Now, understand me definitely
Thanking you for your promptness.
He was so extremely susceptible
Like a wandering star I fell through the deeps of desire
Let us now see the results
The mystery obsessed him
The moonlight lay like snow
An indefinable resemblance to a goat
But suppose the fact
We shall await your early commands with interest
Immured in a trivial round of duty       [immured = confine within]
Like a dew-drop, ill-fitted to sustain unkindly shocks
A burlesque feint of evading a blow
Now, it is an undoubted fact
Stirred into a true access of enthusiasm
We may all of us agree
But there is much more than this
But there is another duty imposed
Children watch more than three hours of tv each day
My love's like the steadfast sun
Each like a corpse within its grave
Now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau, stripped of his gaudy hues
I do not think it possible
like a pent-up storm craving for outlet
splendid but chill
But now I'll confide something to you
like a cold hand upon one's living soul
The proof of this statement is to be found
I ask you calmly and dispassionately
There was a mournful and dim haze around the moon
Granting all this
That shows the infirmity of his judgment
Meanwhile let us freely recognize
Unutterable things pressing on my soul
But I shall go still further
A glance that flitted like a bird
I must call your attention for a moment
I am not vindictive
A mixture of malignancy and madness
What, then, can be the reason
L
Thus instances occur now and then
If we would not be beguiled
An erect, martial, majestic, and imposing personage
He bowed submission
In the garden was a red shed
The terrible past lay afar, like a dream left behind in the night
I may be allowed to make one remark
He flushed the toilet twice
Can you lightly contemplate
It is not within the scope of this address
In my view
Too sanguine a forecast   [sanguine = cheerfully confident; optimistic]
I shall desist from
A melancholy preponderance of mischief
I can scarcely accept the offer
Unwavering and unquestioning approbation
It is not a matter of the slightest consequence
In pursuance of these views
But the greatest proof of all
A secret sweeter than the sea or sky can whisper
Indulge a train of gentle recollection
The opulent sunset
Days of vague and fantastic melancholy
A crumb of consolation
Gleams of sunlight, bewildered like ourselves,
Goaded on by his sense of strange importance
In this brief survey
Her eyes dilated with pain and fear
Hoping that our relations may prove mutually satisfactory
It may or may not be true
Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept
Perpetually excite our curiosity
That is really good of you
I have said and I repeat
The red tape of officialdom was stifling him
My worst suspicions were confirmed
White hands she moves like swimming swans
Chill breath of winter
Fix'd like a beacon-tower above the waves of a tempest
Sharply and definitely conceived
I regret the time limits me
Answering your recent inquiry
An elaborate assumption of indifference
We have endeavored to serve the needs of your organization
The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet
The sky was clear and blue, and the air as soft as milk
A wile of the devil's       [wile = trick intended to deceive or ensnare]
No distinct test can be named
Like a ball of ice it glittered in a frozen sea of sky
as contentedly as cattle in a fresh meadow
It appears from what has been said
I don't doubt it for a moment
And here I am led to observe
Clothed with the witchery of fiction
Through ever-widening circles of devastation
I can not stop to give in detail
Flashed with the brilliancy of a well-cut jewel
Brittle and bent like a bow
I offer my humblest apologies
This is the position of our minds
Overshadowed by a fretful anxiety
The words stabbed him
I had fun doing this
Let it be remembered
I am perfectly willing to admit
It was the most amazing thing I ever heard
I saw a river of men marching like a tide
Let us be perfectly just
This was all there was to show for years of sorrow and bitterness
Have I exaggerated
But to say the truth
It suggests at the outset
Unless I could be sure
Any information you give us will be appreciated
Yet it is no less true
Withal decidedly handsome
For we all know
I have heard the Hiddon People like the hum of swarming bees
A question deep almost as the mystery of life
White as a ghost from darkness
Three-cornered notes fly about like butterflies
Her solicitude thrilled him
I have depicted
I hope to be excused if
Noisy torrent of talk
Perhaps I ought to say
A faint, transient, wistful smile lightened her brooding face
Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed
                                     [abstruse = difficult to understand]
Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten
An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all
But I simply ask
And yet I can not but reflect
In terms of imperishable beauty
If the bare facts were studied
Like the sea whose waves are set in motion by the winds
If ever I can repay it, command me
It will be readily appreciated
I am old enough to remember
If on the contrary, we all foresee
There is a lesson of profound interest
The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected
Don't ride on the sidewalk
I shall be pleased to forward descriptive circulars
In the scheme of things
The toast I am about to propose to you
That is what I call intelligent criticism
Sadly counterbalanced by numerous faults
These were great memories
no human feet had walked
As delightful to the mind as cool well-water to thirsty lip
Let me add one other hint
After an eternity of resolutions, doubts, and indecisions
A staccato cough interrupted the flow of speech
Again, it is urged
How shall I attempt to enumerate
An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare
I feel sure
Dispel all anxious concern
It will be to your advantage
The cutlass had no scabbard
I imagine that no one will be disposed
I need not, I am certain, assure you
But I am very sorry to say
I generally trust my first impressions
This sentiment was well-nigh universal
We want every opportunity to demonstrate our willingness
Here is your opportunity to excel
I have been touched by the large generosity
Polished as the bosom of a star
This I conceive to be the business
Should you decide to act upon this latter suggestion
                                           [woof = crosswise threads]
I have no fear of myself
From the standpoint of
I shall with your sanction
The charming omniscience of youth
I am most grateful for the opportunity
The breathless hours like phantoms stole away
I believe you
I ask again
We have come to the conclusion
I shall address myself to a single point
Merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion
Disdaining the guidance of reason
It moved me to a strange exhilaration
Perhaps, however, some among you will be
I think that I can venture to say
This is a very one-sided conception
Fit to stand the gaze of millions
An inspired ray was in his eyes
Do you ask how that can be
These were the sickening contrasts and diabolic ironies of life
And here I have an opportunity
I know from experience how
I most humbly ask pardon
You excite my curiosity
His face caught the full strength of the rising wind
I shall not undertake to prophesy
A crop of disappointments
We deeply appreciate the circumstances of
He who is insensible to
A strong assumption of superiority
Now, you will understand from this
Does it ever occur to you
I confess I feel not the least alarmed
It was really an extraordinary experience
It is by no means my design
His whole tone was flippant
He dropped into an eloquent silence
Seize the auspicious moment
It remains that I should say a few words
Laughter like the sudden outburst of the glad bird in the tree-top
If your view is right
It will carry out my meaning more fully
Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers
Indulging a sickly and nauseating petulance
The give and take was delicious
It is a rather melancholy thought
Like a shadow on a fair sunlit landscape
What was the consequence of
Paralyzing doubts and scruples
He raised a silencing hand
And if this be true
I have not particularly referred to
Memory was busy at his heart
Time was dissolving the circle of his friends
Let us remember this
That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along
I presume that I shall not be disbelieved
Unbounded devotion and indulgence
You must eat your vegetables
It will be just as reasonable to say
Only so much do I know
We have no means of knowing
Events took an unexpected sinister turn
We had an argument
It is a most unfortunate affair
The result of the whole
As well might we compare
Her lashes like fans upon her cheek
A furtive groping after knowledge
We regret to learn that you are disappointed
A tiny stream meandering amiably
The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time
Like leviathans afloat
Infrequent carriages sped like mechanical toys guided by manikins
Her pulses flutter'd like a dove
I am not presumptuous to assert
It scarcely seems to be in keeping
We have not had the pleasure of placing your name on our ledgers
You will allow me to say with becoming brevity
Deliberate and cautious reflection
His shrewd gaze fixed appraisingly upon her
Her voice had a wooden resonance and a ghost of a lisp
Morn, in yellow and white, came broadening out of the mountains
The tone betrayed a curious irritation
There was but one alternative
The paraphernalia of power and prosperity
A flood of pride rose in him
It came to him with a stab of enlightenment
An opinion has now become established
With sounds like breakers
Let me give you an illustration
The pretty and delicate game of talk
If you will pardon me the frankness
An excessive refinement of feeling
Love conquers all
I cannot say definitely at the moment
My soul was as a lampless sea
Admitted with a childlike cheerfulness
We are accustomed to lay stress upon
I will not positively say
I can scarcely find fitting words
He mused a little while in grave thought
Championing the cause of religious education
Parading an exception to prove a rule
The inference is obvious
Assuring you of our entire willingness to comply with your request
I felt no qualms about my actions
In a word, gentlemen
Superior in strength and prowess
His mind was dazed and wandering in a mist of memories
I notice it as affording an instance
I believe most profoundly
The sentiment which you have expressed
If you give this matter your prompt attention
Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way
Now, I shall not occupy your time
I forbear to inquire
A very elusive and delicate thought
Tethered to earth
Thought shook through her in poignant pictures
How extraordinary!
A gay exuberance of ambition
I am conscious of the fact
So long as we continue to love truth and duty
Moods of malicious reaction and vindictive recoil
lies self-embalmed amidst the moldering trees
I was plumbing the depth of my own fears
I do not in the least degree
Virtually accomplished, I believe
All unconscious as a flower
He turned white as chalk
The sum total of her impressions was negative
                                        [maudlin = tearfully sentimental]
                                       [vituperation = abusive language]
His glorious moments were strung like pearls upon a string
I pause to confess once more
I have already stated, and now repeat
I assure you it is most painful to me
Ineffable sensation of irritability
Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise,
Unrivaled beauty and excellence
Poignant doubts and misgivings
And here I come to the closing evidence
And with these thoughts come others
A request for further particulars will not involve any obligation
Do you think, then
He spoke with sledgehammer directness
A strong convulsion shook the vague indefinite form
The first business of every man
Like mice that steal in and out as if they feared the light
It is I who should ask forgiveness
A kind of fantastic patchwork
The scent of roses stole in with every breath of air
Night after night the skies were wine-blue and bubbling with stars
A sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion
Nothing could be more delightful
My next objection is
Like a high and radiant ocean
Permit me to add another circumstance
I think we may all easily see
We should be convinced
Like drawing nectar in a sieve
You are evidently aware that there is a growing demand
The phrase was like a spear-thrust
It is too plain to be argued
Selfish and uselessly recondite       [recondite = not easily understood]
Like the foam on the river
An undefined sadness seemed to have fallen about her like a cloud
Through the riot of his senses, like a silver blaze, ran the legend
Then there is another story
Companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm
our communication with them
It seems incredible
A somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve
Love smiled like an unclouded sun
Half a glass of water is better than none
Disguised in sentimental frippery
I will face thy wrath though it bite as a sword
In the existing circumstances
Her lips like a lovely song that ripples as it flows
You may well study the example
But that I may not divert you from
I will not relinquish the confidence
I believe it to be the simple truth
All embrowned and mossed with age
I might go on indefinitely
How infinitely difficult it is
I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere
Like bright lamps, the fabled apples glow
The heavens are like a scroll unfurled
It is my earnest wish
Now, sir, I am truly horrified
It would be imprudent in me
Small fish and large fish swam together
I wish to begin my statement
O
Inimitable grace and felicity   [inimitable = defying imitation; matchless]
The pine trees waved as waves a woman's hair
An artful stroke of policy
It seems then that on the whole
The coins banged around in his pocket
I have been favorably impressed by your
Unequaled simplicity and directness of purpose
Not that I quarrel with
Panting after distinction
It has amused me hugely
A torn and tumultuous sky
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
We suggest that you consider building a deck
That is a very practical explanation
A kind of surly reluctance
It will be interesting to trace
A copious torrent of pleasantry
If it is contended
Await the sentence of impartial posterity
The main cause of all this
I shall give it in the words of
Without my saying a word more
Never for a moment believe
Evanescent as bubbles                [evanescent  = vanishing like vapor]
Occasional flashes of tenderness and love
I feel the task is far beyond my power
Suddenly snuffed out in the middle of ambitious schemes
Yet I am convinced
His words trailed off suddenly
Her neck is like a stately tower
I doubt the truth of that saying
Something sharp and brilliant, like the glitter of a sword
I have no excuse for intruding
I think that is rather a brilliant idea
A truth begirt with fire
It is but fair to say
Unapproachable grandeur and simplicity
Spiritual and moral significance
Doled out in miserly measure
I am delighted to hear you say so
His face showed a pleased bewilderment
I see disapproval in your face
This is suggested to us
She strangled a fierce tide of feeling that welled up within her
Pray, sir, let me say
New ambitions pushed him onwards
I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility
She flushed an agitated pink
It reminds one of the compliment
And do you really think
In regard to your proposition
True it is
I entertain no such chimerical hopes   [chimerical = highly improbable]
I have not the influence you think
Merge imperceptibly into one another like the hues of the prism
If we embark upon a career
Lost in irritable reflection
I mention it to you to justify
Put on gravity like a robe
A fact of vast moment
Pertinent to the thread of the discussion
If you seek the real meaning of
Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously
The information is in the brochure
I shall not attempt a detailed narrative
                                    [approbation = warm approval; praise]
In this necessarily brief and imperfect review
The time, gliding like a dream
The chill of night crept in from the street
The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening
It may be plausibly objected
Thy name will be as honey on men's lips
He affected neither pomp nor grandeur
Amaze and confound the imagination
The grimaces and caperings of buffoonery
I dare say you know
A dead leaf might as reasonably demand to return to the tree
Now, I admit
To sum up in one word
No greater service could be rendered
Devices generally held to be discreditable
Like the rainbow, thou didst fade
On every coin was a picture of the Queen
As it will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our ability
The whole thing is an idle fancy
She recaptured herself with difficulty
He was the most skeptical
The sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside
Exposing his arrogance and folly to merited contempt
The train is running two hours late
If it be true
Above all things, let us not forget
He had a childish belief in his own ability
Now, this is precisely the danger
Drift along the stream of fancy
It was the ecstasy and festival of summer
Fettered by poverty and toil
Impotent outbreaks of unreasoning rage
Dawn had broken
He felt no more than a lukewarm and selfish love
And yet I think we all feel
The car has just been serviced
He felt the ironic rebound of her words
An intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth
Suddenly, like death, the truth flashed on them
It is difficult to describe
The very obvious moral is this
The flaccid moods of prose
I will not allude
The train comprised ten carriages
Provocative of bitter hostility
I thought you were seriously indisposed
I might well think
Then you're really not disinclined?
I shall not enlarge upon
The deepest wants and aspirations of his soul
I am determined
In addressing myself to the question
Enclosed we beg to hand you
It is ridiculous to say
Pelting one another with catchwords
I am seriously annoyed with myself about it
You could not pay me a higher compliment
Roses are red
She twitted him merrily
                                     [lineament = characteristic feature]
Like a yellow silken scarf the thick fog hangs
Warped by personal pretensions and self-consequence
He set his imagination free
To convince them of this
Let no man congratulate himself
I shall take a broader view of the subject
I cannot find much real satisfaction in it
Reflections such as these
A many-sided and far-reaching enthusiasm
At the mercy of small prejudices
An uncomfortable premonition of fear
There is another point of view
In a diversity of application
A perversion of judgment
Stupendous and awe-inspiring spectacle
Were I to speculate
A state of sullen self-absorption
His youthful zeal was contagious
The idiosyncratic peculiarities of thought
First of all I ask
I beg to tender my most fervent wishes
I anticipate with pleasing expectation
Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity
Artless and unquestioning devotion
I deny, once and for all
And lo! and behold
They sit heavy on the soul
As still as a stone
Slender experience of the facts of life
Let us grant that for the sake of the argument
I do not deem it incumbent upon me
Untiring enunciation of platitudes and fallacies
Their authenticity may be greatly questioned
If I may say so without presumption
In a musing ecstasy of contemplation
There is no sense in saying
Kindly read the enclosed list
I have heard with relief and pleasure
I capitulated by mistake
It would be no less impracticable
Sugared remonstrances and cajoleries
He loved nothing more than hiking in northern New Mexico
Seem to swim in a sort of blurred mist before the eyes
A deliciously tantalizing sense
Will you allow me to ask you a question?
They are painted sharp as death
So you observe the transformation?
To what other cause can you ascribe
It is doubtful whether
I have scant patience
Yet I am willing to admit
You have been pleased to confer upon me
The iron hand of oppression
In addressing you I feel
In moments of swift and momentous decision
To bring the matter nearer home
I hate to do this to you
It has a lovely situation as I remember it
And all our thoughts ran into tears like sunshine into rain
Averted by some happy stroke of fortune
The moment marked an epoch
We have the good fortune to-night
Startling as this may appear to you
It is upon this line of reasoning
The sky put on the panoply of evening
Now, from these instances it is plain
Seem to savor of paradox
I have racked this brain of mine
Those are pleasant flowers
An intentional breach of politeness
And yet we ought, if we are wise
Here was a face both acute and intelligent
Swamping every aspiration and ambition
Very well, I will consent
You have done me great honor
And sometimes it will be difficult
I can not say with confidence
I should find it hard to discover
Smug respectability and self-content
She permitted herself a delicate little smile
U
We may indeed consider
The after dinner speeches were boring
Tossed disdainfully off from young and ardent lips
Brilliant display of ingenious argument
It's mere pride of opinion
Wrapt in inward contemplation
I should like at least to mention
Overwhelmed with reproach and popular indignation
He made the politest of monosyllabic replies
It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss
A light wind outside the lattice swayed a branch of roses to and fro,
It is an error of taste
I have sometimes vaguely felt it
And now allow me to call attention
Are we content to believe
The incorrigibility of perverse human nature
Among the problems that confront us
I think I might safely say
Is it not marvelous
I profess
No one can feel this more strongly
He adroitly shifted his ground
I must respectfully decline to tell you
Like bursting waves from the ocean
Hearts unfold like flowers before thee
Sweet as the rain at noon
That is a humiliating thought
Appalled in speechless disgust
Still I have generally found
Meanwhile permit me to thank you for your kind attention
She let the soft waves of her deep hair fall like flowers from Paradise
By temperament incompatible
I do not indulge in the delusion
I may venture upon a review
Think for a moment
Gone like a glow on the cloud at the close of day
The first remarkable instance was
I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy
A lady that lean'd on his arm like a queen in a fable of old fairy days
A man in my situation has
She thrived on insincerity
Pitiful shifts of policy
Beyond the dreams of avarice
After a careful study of all the evidence
He laughed away my protestations
His heart was full of enterprise
I will only sum up my evidence
Insatiably greedy of recognition
A crystallized embodiment of the age
Sensuous enjoyment of the outward show of life
If we pursue a different course
                       [impute = relate to a particular cause or source]
There streamed into the air the sweet smell of crushed grass, as though
I know not of my own knowledge
The romantic ardor of a generous mind
No, I am speaking seriously
Like bright Apollo
Let us attempt a survey
I should like to see that view answered
Nerveless and faithless folly
I think I know what you are going to say
It will be well and wise
The exaggerations of morbid hallucinations
I ask you in all candor
Staring in helpless bewilderment
Like wine-stain to a flask the old distrust still clings
I hope I may be allowed to intimate
But now take notice of
The utmost excitement and agitation
Freighted with strange, vague longings
So innocent in her exuberant happiness
I think we take too narrow a view
I have no wish at all to preach
I have seen it stated in a recent journal
What, then, are we to believe
As we have received no response from you
I do not wonder
We trust you will not consider us unduly strict
Like mariners pulling the life-boat
His voice insensibly grew inquisitorial
Insufferable violence to the feelings
These questions I shall examine
I think when we look back upon
But lo! all of a sudden
He drove away with speed
The air darkened swiftly
It is a curious fact
Agitated and enthralled by day-dreams
Innumerable and incessant creations
But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that
Let me make myself distinctly understood
Intense sensitiveness to injustice
Argued with immense force and feeling
I turn, gentlemen, to the case
One of the things I recollect with most pride
Let us cherish
Unreasoning and unquestioning attachment
So, to add one other example
When I speak of this question
I will take it only under compulsion
With possibly a single exception
Amid the rush and roar of life
In all or any of these views
The leaves of time drop stealthily
A fawn-colored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
I am thinking about getting a cat
We regret our inability to meet your wishes
But you do not know for certain
Life had been arrested, as the horologist,
It is my agreeable duty
Like footsteps upon wool
Up to this moment I have stated
I am quite interested to see what you will do
Thrilled to the depths of her being
But I will not further impress any idea
You ask me--but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do
If it is not convenient for you
But that's a tremendous hazard
I am a great admirer
I am so glad you think that
This is not the occasion or the place
May I ask you to believe
Heavy vehicles must use the outside lane
I cannot imagine what you mean
You have had a pleasant time, I hope
In a tone of musing surprise
I thoroughly agree with you
It was as futile as to oppose an earthquake with argument
His face was glad as dawn to me
Here, however, it may be objected
The sausage was passed from mouth to mouth
Heights of serene contemplation
I capitulated by inadvertence
                            [lapis-lazuli = opaque to translucent blue,
This matter has been considered very seriously
Render null and void
Your orders and commands will always have our prompt and best attention
Her voice was questioning
I will not attempt to note
It is a wholesome symptom
If I venture a few remarks
And even if it were so?
The causes for the delay were beyond our control
It is a sure sign
Hardly will anyone venture to say
Don't be so conventional
Like the sea-worm, that perforates the shell of the mussel,
Let us pause a moment
The vast cathedral of the world
Personally, I am far too firm a believer
Her words sounding like wavelets on a summer shore
His thoughts were in clamoring confusion
The purse-proud inflation of the moneyed man
It is true, I am grieved to say
If you are interested, please let us hear from you
Times of unexampled difficulty
I venture to ask permission
Whatever difference of opinion may exist
I am perfectly aware of what I am saying
The outraged conscience of mankind
Wholly devoid of public interest
The result, I fancy, has been
My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it
Based on a fundamental error
She swept away all opposing opinion with the swift rush of her enthusiasm
I spoke only in jest
Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
With whatever opinions we come here
The book was open
It is fatal to suppose
Here is good hope for us
The summit of excellence
I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes
I do not desire to put too much emphasis
The victim of an increasing irritability
So then ought we also
I ask that you be good enough to bring me some water
This being true
The mind freezes at the thought
Her voice was like the voice the stars had when they sang together
The beauty straightway vanished
Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side
There are those of us who can remember
The world is in a simmer, like a sea
Thus we see
It's positively insane
It is unnecessary to multiply instances
We are assembled here to-day
At once misleading and infelicitous
That was very well reasoned
A recrudescence of superstition
I beg again to thank you for the honor
He set his imagination adrift
It must doubtless be admitted
Never before have I so strongly felt
It seems almost incredible
It is a touching reflection
The army like a witch's caldron seethed
Products of dreaming indolence
I think it might be said with safety
Fluent as a rill, that wanders silver-footed down a hill
Simple and obvious to a plain understanding
By a happy turn of thinking
The accelerated beat of his thoughts
like prison-warders hand-cuffing a convict
Fled like sweet dreams
Permit us to express our sincere appreciation
I am listening--I was about to propose
The critical eyes of posterity
I desire to bear my testimony
And when we pass beyond the bounds of
It is a very significant fact
The penetrating odors assailed his memory as something unforgettable
We regret that owing to the press of business
She was silent, standing before him like a little statuesque figure
Are you fully reconciled?
We take it for granted
Do I need to describe
A vast sweet silence crept through the trees
Thank you for your good intentions
In agreement with this obvious conclusion
Her bright eyes were triumphant
In looking about me
I have but one more word to add
It seems as motionless and still as the zenith in the skies
Never was there an instance
Nothing but the deepest sense
His mind echoed with the words
An involuntary gesture of remonstrance
A warmth of seemingly generous indignations
In this there is no contradiction
No longer shall slander's venomed spite crawl
Impressive as a warrant of arrest for high treason
It is perfectly apparent
A delicious throng of sensations
We must realize conscientiously
as chasing butterflies might rest together on a flower
The velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous
In a whirlwind of feeling and memory
Meteors that dart like screaming birds
Sheer midsummer madness
To me, however, it would appear
The sinister influence of unprincipled men
I rise in behalf
ran through the texture of his mind and died away
I am by no means certain
Rich as the dawn
The sudden rush of the awakened mind
I would suggest first of all
It was wrong to harbor this deep and brooding resentment
I have no such gloomy forebodings
We would request, as a special favor
His brow grew knit and gloomy
The benign look of a father
He was empty of thought
I take it for granted
I love her with all my heart
I have had the honor
I protest I never had any doubt
How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?
The practical inference from all this
This argument is especially cogent     [cogent = powerfully persuasive]
There is, however, one caution
An incredible mental agility
The snake bit me
Either way is perplexing
Her banners like a thousand sunsets glow
In my humble opinion
Spread like wildfire
You could hear the monster inhaling
Straight as an arrow
Well, you are a dreamer!
All confess this to be true
The proprieties of etiquette
Look at the situation
A time of disillusion followed
Clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity
I remember full well
We feel keenly about such things
It is, all things considered, a fact
Cold gaze of curiosity
Not averse to a little gossip
I ask you to pledge with me
It may at first sight seem strange
Transitory as clouds without substance
like a chill and sudden gust from some unknown sea
Yet let me consider what consequences must
An air of being meticulously explicit
Hence it follows
A sigh of large contentment
I have not time to present
White like flame
She strangled the anger that welled up within her
The blue bowl of the sky, all glorious with the blaze of a million worlds
I might deny that
Decidedly so
Down the steep of disenchantment
Alien paths and irrelevant junketings
Yes, that's undeniable
Her face changed with each turn of their talk,
An omnibus across the bridge crawls like a yellow butterfly
A law of retributive justice
This life is like a bubble blown up in the air
In a spirit of indulgent irony, we agreed with him
I deem myself honored
Motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber
I entirely approve of your plan
I am to urge the interest of
I have often been impressed with
Growing sense of bewilderment and dismay
Indeed, I may fairly say
Like sheep from out the fold of the sky, stars leapt
I do not desire to call in question
Her lips are like two budded roses
Shining like the dewy star of dawn
Mawkishly effeminate sentiment
Such is the deep prejudice now existing
As ridiculous as it was unnecessary
Mathematics is diffult
I really am curious to know how you guessed that
I am not sure that I can manage it
Then, too, it must be remembered
I do not complain of
Deeply moved as well as keenly stung
A rather desperate procedure
Tree and shrub altered their values
In an unguarded moment
I said that I thought
that made his words stand out like the raised type for the blind
when the wind wearily sighs in the grass
The virtue of taciturnity     [taciturnity  = habitually untalkative]
So I say to you
The mellowing hand of time
She stood her ground with dignity
Creeping like a snail, unwillingly to school
Don't let me encroach on your good nature
Looking forward to the early receipt of some of your orders
We easily persuade ourselves
Let us begin by examining
You say that as though you were surprised
I hardly think that could be so
I am not going to pay you any idle compliments
Like helpless birds in the warm nest
It is an incredible thing
A cynical and selfish hedonist
Accordingly by reason of this circumstance
His first zeal was flagging
I foresaw the consequence
If we cast our glance back
I am vastly obliged to you
And more than this
Her mouth was wide open
She stilled and trampled on the inward protest
Let me ask you to imagine
                                        [chimerical = highly improbable]
As to the particular instance before us
In the very brief space at our disposal
Allied with a marked imperiousness   [imperious = arrogantly overbearing]
Events took an unexpected turn
Steadfast as the soul of truth
It is an unquestionable truth
I am prepared to back that opinion by
It is a truth universally acknowledged
Strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets
I must be contented with
He had the gift of deep, dark silences
So much at first sight
Cheeks as soft as July peaches
It has struck me very forcibly
Thank you for your expression of confidence
A treacherous throb of her voice
But this I do not hesitate to say
And this is really the sense
Like green waves on the sea
A keenly receptive and intensely sensitive temperament
Her beauty fervent as a fiery moon
I would also gratefully acknowledge
I am sure I feel no hostility
As explained in our previous letter
I summon you to do your share
I see around me
Displayed enormous power and splendor
This privileged communication is for your exclusive use
What you have just said is even truer than you realize
I was as sensitive as a barometer
It is indeed very clear
It summons our imagination
Love as clean as starlight
Proud as the proudest of church dignitaries
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
I fear I may seem trifling
Slow and resistless forces of conviction
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
We are fulfilling what I believe to be
A long accumulating store of discontent and unrest
And fell as cold as a lump of clay
Subdued passages of unobtrusive majesty
A few pens parched by long disuse
You see how widely we differ
Strange streak of melancholy
The fitful swerving of passion
A century of disillusionment
I challenge any man
He saw disaster like a ghostly figure following her
Pouting like the snowy buds o' roses in July
like a bather lingering on the brink
Be these things as they may
The tension of struggling tears which strove for an outlet
Calculated to create disgust
Still I know what answer I can make to
Her stumbling ignorance was showing
like the sweep of sun-rent clouds over a quiet landscape
This is the point I want to impress upon you
Abounding bodily vigor
A sort of incredulous stupefaction
In order to realize adequately
To-day, as never before
There was hostile intent
Swimming was the best part of the holiday
A thousand mangled delusions
Doubts beset her lonely and daring soul
It would indeed be unworthy
Like sounds of wind and flood
It is not always fair to judge by appearances
Hair as harsh as tropical grass and gray as ashes
As swift as thought
One word more in a serious vein
She regarded him stonily out of flint-blue eyes
But why do I numerate these details
But, my friends, pause for a moment
When I am told
Let us remind ourselves
It is quite an easy matter
I have gone back to my first impressions
It is within the memory of men now living
One has no choice to endure it
But that must be always the impression
Their minds rested upon the thought,
It must ever be recollected
And how is it possible to imagine
There will always be a number of men
Spinning a network of falsehoods
The answer is ready
I admit it most gratefully
It would be natural on such an occasion
An open and violent rupture
I am giving voice to what you all feel
His brow bent like a cliff o'er his thoughts
We had a breathless night of suspense
We plucked flowers from wood and field
I confess that I do not entirely approve
                            [propitious = auspicious, favorable; kindly]
I must mention with praise
This is the design and intention
It will not alter my determination
No doubt, in the first instance
But first of all, remark, I beg you
This is really appalling
Surely it is not too much for me to say
The lofty grace of a prince
It must never be forgotten
An indefinable taint of priggishness
And yet let me say to you
But we are met with the assertion
Tenderness breathed from her
You need to be flexible
A callous and conscienceless brute
The sunset was rushing to its height
But there's one thing you haven't said
I suppose I ought to feel flattered
The rising storm of words
His spirits sank like a stone
That is most fortunate
They had slipped away like visions
A firm and balanced manhood
The mortal coldness of the soul, like death itself comes down
I beg you not to mistake my meaning
I think you are rather severe in your opinions
The next thing I consider indispensable
A vague and wistful melancholy
He braced himself to the exquisite burden of life
On a review of the whole subject
I hope most sincerely and truly
A more than ordinary share of baseness and depravity
You have sometimes been astonished
As the dew upon the roses warms and melts the morning light
Clear and definite like the glance of a child or the voice of a girl
Like mountain streams we meet and part
But, sir, it is manifest
Scattered love as stars do light
In any event, a reply to this will be very much appreciated
Who is your sagacious adviser?       [sagacious = sound judgment, wise]
I have always maintained
What an extraordinary idea!
It is convenient and cheap
still must croon her ancient sorrows to the cold white moon
The scars of rancor and remorse
Thus much may be sufficient to recall
There is a most serious lesson
In fine, it is no extravagance to say
It is the policy of our house
I have a great admiration for
I will suppose the objection to be
Said with epigrammatic point          [epigrammatic = terse and witty]
I must be careful about what I say
She cherished no petty resentments
To this it will be replied
I have no reason to think
It also pleases me very much
Look at some of these questions
I am myself greatly indebted
It gives one a little grip at the throat
I pray God I may never
I need not wander far in search
Certainly not, if it displeases you
Whilst I am on this matter
We shall be blind not to perceive
If this seems doubtful to anyone
                                                  [cumbrous = cumbersome]
Rare fidelity of purpose and achievement
We have much pleasure in answering your inquiry
Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun
The bus fare is fifty cents
A dire monotony of bookish idiom
With words like honey melting from the comb
It is very doubtful whether
Why did you desert us so entirely?
But still, I repeat
It is a vision which still inspires us
Able men have reasoned out
She spoke with sweet severity
The most striking characteristic
His gestures and his gait were untidy
Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth
All this suggests
This will be evident at once
In reply thereto, we wish to inform you
Thanks for your recent payment
We sat beneath an always fleeting sky
Accept our thanks for your recent remittance
There was no menace in the night's silvern calmness
Vouch for its truth
This little independent thread of inquiry
We are confident that you will have no further trouble
I respect your critical faculty
Like to diamonds her white teeth shone between the parted lips
I am dumb with admiration
Kindly mornings when autumn and winter
And night, as welcome as a friend
A bewildering labyrinth of facts
It is certainly especially pleasant
Your presence seems to say
We thank you for your courteous letter
Overcome by an access of misery
All the signs of the time indicate
Mockery crept into her tone
I am absolutely bewildered
Your satisfaction will dictate our course
I rejoice to think I remark here
If, on the other hand, I say
The world is bitter as a tear
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like moldy hay
I can not conceive a greater honor
Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts       [unwonted = unusual]
To some it may sound like a paradox
You have no right
After full deliberation
It's been a strange experience for you
A sort of stolid despairing acquiescence
An alarmed sense of strange responsibilities
I respect you for that
His formal kiss fell chill as a flake of snow on the cheek
It would be preposterous to say
Glistening like threads of gold
It is nevertheless true
I salute with profound reverence
We admit that you are justified in your complaint
His heart was full of enterprise
I hope you will not accuse me
Like dew upon a sleeping flower
A thoroughly sincere and unaffected effort
Now, I pass on to consider
Free as the winds that caress
I have the strongest possible prejudice against it
And I refuse assent
The homely virtue of practical utility
Well, that being the case, I say
Like a noisy argument in a drawing-room
And now that I have mentioned
Infantile insensibility to the solemnity of his bereavement
The tendency to evade implicit obligations
Pelted with an interminable torrent of words
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
Who can deny the effect
Their ephemeral but enchanting beauty had expired forever
A swaggering air of braggadocio      [braggadocio = pretentious bragging]
We have your request for information regarding
Is that a fair question?
Faithfully and religiously eschewed        [eschew = avoid; shun]
The dolphin was a creature of delicate and rapid responses
What I propose to do is
The excitement of the thought
I have every reason to think so
As distinct as night and morning
How like the sky she bends over her child
Her voice was full of temper, hard-held
He writhed with impotent humiliation
I think we may well congratulate each other
In this connection I remind myself
I shall be glad if you will join me
A prevailing sentiment of uneasy discontent
As I have now replied to
The day was blind with fog
Let me illustrate again
I am convinced by what I have seen
He felt the ironic rebound of her words
But the question may arise
I seem to have heard that sentiment before
I am most deeply sensible of the welcome
I can not justly be responsible because
Paramount obligation and righteousness
The father's vigil of questioning sorrow
I would not dwell upon that matter if
The lights blazed up like day
Debasing fancies gather like foul birds
Those death-like eyes, unconscious of the sun
Inward appraisal and self-renouncement
For some years my hair has been thinning
My views are altered in many respects
Please feel assured that we shall use every endeavor
I see no reason for doubting
His youthful zeal was contagious
Lost like the lightning in the sullen clod
It is substantially true
I should like to emphasize
It follows inevitably
I indulge the modest hope
School is useful, believe it or not
It is a curious trait
A contemptible species of mockery
By a curious chance, I know it very well
I am grateful for your good opinion
Is it not universally recognized
Summing up what I have said
I feel constrained to declare
I have had to take a long sweep
I need not assure this brilliant company
An unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his heart
May I ask you to do us a great favor by
She has great eyes like the doe
He feels it acutely
A flourish of rhetoric
Glances and smiles of tacit contempt
The murmuring of summer seas
The sound is like a silver-fountain that springeth in a golden basin
Diffidence overwhelmed him
That is eminently proper
We think you will agree
A hot and virulent skirmish
A withering sensation of ineffable boredom
I want to have a frank understanding with you
His face caught the full strength of the rising wind
Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk
I remember the occasion perfectly
As inaccessible to his feet as the clefts and gorges of the clouds
Let us do all we can
Full and tuneful diction
Dignity and sweet patience were in her look
                               [calumnies = maliciously false statements]
The land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
I can by no calculation justify
I shall hope to interest you
A mercenary marriage
It will receive the same careful attention
I have a very high respect for
The beating of her heart was like a drum
The clouds drifted across the sky
She hated his endlessly shifting moods
Let me quite temperately defend
In point of fact
A late star lingered, remotely burning
I should like to refer to two events
I must ask an abrupt question
You are not serious, I hope
One of these signs is the fact
An incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious
Dazzled by their novelty and brilliance
An increased gentleness of aspect
I go further
But more than all things else
I wish you to observe
He was ever so polite
An air which was distinctly critical
It is to me a very sincere satisfaction
Themes of perennial interest
The air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers
It is not altogether satisfactory
I think we are justified
It is asserted
Diversity of mind and temperament
He fell as falls some forest lion, fighting well
But I submit the whole subject
It will be evident to you
A vehement and direct attack
As shallow streams run dimpling all the way
The curling wreaths like turbans seem
T
Those are my own private feelings
The night like a battle-broken host is driven before
One would naturally suppose
I am also bound to say
If at first view this should seem
But it will naturally be asked
There is another object equally important
It is interesting and suggestive
And the reason is very obvious
Openly flouted and disavowed
as when a coin, tested, rings true gold
He had lost the freedom and integrity of soul
That's so rude
The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans
In the highest conceivable degree
A certain implication of admiring confidence
rattled gustily against the windows
I have yet to learn
We thank you very gratefully for your polite and friendly letter
Volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions
But some will ask me
Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling
It came to him suddenly
What, then, is the use
This will amply repay you
I shall say all this without entering into
I am  sure you will hear me out
That, at least, you will agree to
I am not of those who pretend
I shall speak first about
And now the chief points of it
In illustration of what I have said
Comment of rare and delightful flavor
With this ideal clearly before us
As summer winds that creep from flower to flower
She should have been so happy
After reminding the hearer
Flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love
Of course I can not be taken to mean
The explosion loosened the rocks
An attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence
He listened greedily and gazed intent
I assure you my knowledge of it is limited
This was the perfect carnival of fun
But I have no fear of the future
The camp fire reddens like angry skies
I only ask a favorable construction of
like a thick summer haze
Here we can not but pause to contemplate
Diverted into alien channels
A narrow and superficial survey
His mind was like a summer sky
Like those great rivers, whose course everyone beholds,
Yielding like melted snow
How utterly abominable
It is most unfortunate
like a lizard catching flies
You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose
The golden years of youth and maturity
I allude to
They were vastly dissimilar
Tie up the horses here

An air of uncanny familiarity
Oh, that's splendid of you!
There is a large class of thinkers
But the fact is
It is the common consent of men
I can not prevail on myself
My duty is to endeavor to show
Cold and hard as steel
There is yet one other remark
We wrote to you at length
The time is not far distant
That is tragic
Now, what I want you to realize
While I have hinted to you
The veiled future bowed before me like a vision of promise
Either way her fate was cruel
The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood
If you accommodate us, the favor will be greatly appreciated
One winged cloud above like a spread dragon overhangs the west
Beheld great Babel, wrathful, beautiful,
It was very good of you to come out and join us
Let it not be supposed that I impute
Now, let me speak with the greatest care
As mellow and deep as a psalm
In a high degree culpable
Confused rumblings presaging a different epoch
It is one of the most significant things
A nature somewhat frivolous and irresolute
They will be remorselessly swept into oblivion
Life stretched before him alluring and various as the open road
A habit of riding a theory too hard
There is a genuine grief
His mind was dazed and wandering in a mist of memories
Like the sudden impulse of a madman
He was trapped in a paradox
A quenchless thirst for expression
Next, I consider
Please don't go today
My appreciation has been quickened
Sanctuaries where the passions may, like wild falcons,
Light as a snowflake
The flawless triumph of art
The river sang with its lips to the pebbles
It is common in these days to lament
As full of spirit as a gray squirrel
We are able to make you this offer
The chambers of the house were haunted by an incessant echoing,
We stumble and falter and fall
It was a black inky night
Tried by this standard
It is a common error among ignorant people
I realize how painful it must be to you
Common sense indicates
Lapped in soft music of adulation
Mail the enclosed card now
A hideous orgy of massacre and outrage
I have often been struck with the resemblance
I have partly anticipated
We again solicit an opportunity
As locusts gather to a stream before a fire
Whistled life away in perfect contentment
High-handed indifference to all restraint
Noted for their quixotic love of adventure
           [araucaria = evergreen trees of South America and Australia]
So accustomed are we
That is a question I have often proposed to myself
An assumption of hostile intent
Whence was the proof to come
It would be a fruitless and unthankful task
Her tongue on the subject was sharpness itself
The beckonings of alien appeals
We are unable to collect out-standing debts
An entirely negligible quantity
So I inferred
Nor do I think there can be found
It would be absurd to pretend
She felt like an unrepentant criminal
I can not take back my word
A laudable stimulus
A pompous failure
She was radiant with youth
Free from rigid or traditional fetters
I speak forth my sentiment
I must now beg to ask
The day was dull and colorless
The notion is rather new to me
As some vast river of unfailing source
A lightning-phrase, as if shot from the quiver of infallible wisdom
Soft as Spring
Some people think we are too strict
It is quite too absurd
I am, I confess, a little discouraged
I argue this cause
I do not feel at liberty
It may seem a little strange
It was a weird world of morbid horrors
Defiant of analysis and rule
I feel only a great emotion of gratitude
Pardon me if
A sort of stunned incredulity
Princely generosity of praise
I hardly know anything more strange
A glassy stare of horror was all he saw
A frigid touch of the hand
Are we satisfied to assume
Like two flaming stars were his eyes
Lazy merchantmen that crawled like flies over the blue enamel of the sea
An atmosphere of extraordinary languor    [languor = dreamy, lazy mood ]
It is a mark of great instability
I suppose that everyone who listens to me
The brave but turbulent aristocracy ruled
No one need to exaggerate
Pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content
The ultimate verdict of mankind
All her gift of serene immobility brought into play
If any man be so persuaded
And so, in the other cases, I have named
I have no fears for the success
Obviously the matter is settled
An unsuspected moral obtuseness
The facile conjectures of ignorant onlookers
Are there not many of us
Let us assure you of our desire to cooperate with you
Her musings took a sudden and arbitrary twist
But I can not conceive
We received your recent inquiry
Ordinarily speaking, such deductions
If you accommodate us, the favor will be greatly appreciated
                                  [priggishness = exaggerated propriety]
We shall use every endeavor
Anticipated with lively expectation
Now, the question here at issue
Less is more
There is a great deal of rash talking
Do not talk to me of
Well, perhaps it is none of my affair
A solemn gray expanse that lost itself far away in the gray of the sea
I cut the raft adrift
He was imprisoned within an enchanted circle
The ignoble exploitation of public interests
I have thus been led by my feelings
And melting like the stars in June
Well, more's the pity
Something curiously suggestive and engaging
Supple and sweet as a rose in bloom
Her tone was gathering remonstrance
His whole tone was flippant and bumptious
There will be no difficulty
As the accumulation of snowflakes makes the avalanche
In spite of plausible arguments
Disfigured by glaring faults
The subject is extremely interesting
It's such a bore having to talk about it
I am not blind to the faults of
It is greatly assumed
True incentives to knowledge
The point I have urged upon you is
The strangest thought shimmered through her
We are in the habit of saying
Heavily freighted with erudition     [erudition = extensive learning]
It is not difficult to comprehend
A taunting accusation of falsehood
Regretting our inability to serve you in the present instance
He eludes analysis and baffles description
And it is not difficult to see
Heeled like an avalanche to leeward
War is not the answer
When the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless
Oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind,
Her voice like mournful bells crying on the wind
I have long been of the conviction
Do what you will
I know full well
It is manifestly absurd to say
We can presume
Quickness to conceive and courage to execute
Truths which forever shine as fixed stars
Obsessed with the modishness of the hour
We see in a variety of ways
The boat sank rapidly
The door was closed
I am sorry to disillusionize you
I have sometimes fancied
We have thought it best to forward
Luke-warm assurance of continued love
But I may say in conclusion
You will have ample opportunity
His last illusions crumbled
It is not difficult to discern
I would now gladly lay before you
We need no proof to assure us
I should not dream of asking you to do so
One thing I beg of you
A somewhat complicated and abstruse calculation
It should not be objectionable
The level boughs, like bars of iron across the setting sun
All the resources of a burnished rhetoric
Many of you, perhaps, recollect
I want to express the hope that
A flood of external impressions
It strikes me as rather pathetic
Enduring with smiling composure
An unreasoning form of coercion
                                              [salutariness = favorable]
Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire
On the contrary, I am assuming
Subservient to the ends of religion
He paused, stunned and comprehending
Round my chair the children run like little things of dancing gold
The springs of human action
The ambition and rivalship of men
We believe you will readily understand our position
That will blast your chances, I am afraid
Can you imagine anything so horrible?
There is but one consideration
A stooping girl as pale as a pearl
A harvest of barren regrets
like the shimmering necks of doves
I fearlessly challenge
I utter this word with the deepest affection
I hope the day may be far distant
Like a great fragment of the dawn it lay
I do not think you will often hear
I say in moderation
Eyes like limpid pools in shadow
And what do you suppose will be
I beg and implore of you
A tissue of dull excuses
Snatch some advantage
I can not help speaking urgently
I shall add a few words
Oh, yes, you may take that for granted
Preached with a fierce unction        [unction = exaggerated earnestness]
Sights seen as a traveling swallow might see them on the wing
You agree with me, I know
I had almost said
I like it immensely
And here let me give my explanation
like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress
A dangerous varnish of refinement
However, it is to me a very refreshing thing
Let us reflect how vain
The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears
The purple vaulted night
In closing we can only assure you
We are reluctant to adopt such severe measures
A customer made this suggestion
The morning beckons
Rudely reminded of life's serious issues
My head was like a great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper
Intangible as a dream
I regret to inform you that your hamster has died
It is not necessary for me even to sketch
I must find some fault with
There she stood straight as a lily on its stem
                                                [plovers = wading birds]
He lent no countenance to the insensate prattle
The idea was demonized by fashionable society
His voice is as the thin faint song
I consider it amply explains
I may confess to you
Just the reverse is true
Purge the soul of nonsense
Like the rustling of grain moved by the west-wind
I, for my part, would rather
A gross piece of stupidity
He raised a silencing hand
Vast and vague aspirations
That is most kind of you
As an impartial bystander
It is perfectly trite
It grieves me to relate
The maximum of attainable and communicable truth
We must also look
There, like a bird, it sits and sings
A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic
Let us turn to the contemplation of
The instance I shall choose
We rightly pay all honor
Please consider this letter an acknowledgment
I am confronted by the hope
It's absurd--it's impossible
I have been interested in hearing
The garden was laden with the scent of the honeysuckle
It may indeed be unavoidable
The hours crawled by like years
It has been well said
Irrelevant to the main issue
The sanction and authority of a great name
That is all very good
I desire to lay emphatic stress
I must here admit
I do not stop to discuss
Frankly, we believe it is extremely worth while for you
Thus much, however, I may say
With the fullest assurance that we are considering
Men moved hither and thither like insects in their crevices
And I rejoice to know
It's my chief form of recreation
Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag's antlers
I am not defending myself
I will permit myself the liberty of saying
He has a queer conception of the proprieties
Her voice trailed off vaguely
A grave man of pretending exterior
Nor do I pretend
I have a strong belief
She poured out on him the full opulence of a proud recognition
Facile and fertile literary brains
How like a winter hath my absence been
I am at a loss for adequate terms
Painful and lamentable indifference
The landscape ran, laughing, downhill to the sea
Unbreakable as iron
The easy-going indolence of a sedentary life
How can we help believing
I deem it proper here to remind
The leaden sky rests heavily on the earth
The affluent splendor of the summer day
Vigor and richness of resource
I am also satisfied
It is literally impossible
The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose
There was a mild triumph in her tone
I think we can hardly hope
It seems to me singularly appropriate
Sea-gulls flying like flakes of the sea
My first duty is to express to you
Some one will perhaps object
I do not, therefore, wonder
Is it not, then, preposterous
He was disheveled and untidy
Betokening an impulsive character
A vast multitude of facts
The proposition appeals to us as a good one
Permit me to add
We await the courtesy of an early answer
A faint sense of compunction moved her
How many a time
Full of majestic tenderness
That is very gracious
One further word
And then I may be reminded
I have given you the best proof of it
Crystallize about a common nucleus
Invested with a partial authority
Unbends like a loosened bow
Unwholesome influence, I would say
The old infamy will pop into daylight
In that case let me rob you of a few minutes
Like a blossom blown before a breeze,
His voice was thick with resentment and futile protest
The idea is monstrous
Presently she hovered like a fluttering leaf or flake of snow
My attitude would be one of disapproval
As gently as the flower gives forth its perfume
I desire to call attention
At the present writing
Like the fair flower dishevel'd in the wind
She had a fugitive intangible charm
All the facts which support this
Well, now, let us propose
It was a guilty pleasure
I was very much interested
I am free to admit
Nor is this all
I will take the precaution to add
I shall just give the summary of
A faint accent of reproach
                                               [novellete = short novel]
Like a mirage, vague, dimly seen at first
I call on you to answer
Charm upon charm in her was packed, like rose-leaves in a costly vase
Like a golden-shielded army
Fresh and unworn as the sea that breaks languidly beside them
Pardon me, but I don't think so
The current of his ideas flowed full and strong
A storm of public indignation
I say this the more gladly
Let us pass on to another fact
I am writing a book
It amuses you, doesn't it?
Like a river of molten amethyst
burn like a blood-red cloud upon the plain
The day is at hand
The lesson which we should take most to heart
I say no more of these things
Her little lips are tremulous as brook-water is
Ruby is more beautiful than pearl
Therefore we trust you will write to us promptly
Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale
I am reassured by the presence here
Like dead lovers who died true
I believe I can speak for all
Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
You ought not to disregard what I say
These ideas naturally present themselves
I shall not force into the discussion
The feathery meadows like a lilac sea
His swift and caustic satire
You will become morbid if you are not careful
He grew wanton with success
You behaved with great forbearance
Dogs the footsteps
I do not know how anyone can believe
SECTION IX
The teacher scolded the class
By means of crafty insinuations
One of the ancients said
To speak with entire candor
An itching propensity for argument
A manner nervously anxious to please
I am honestly indignant
I have already shown the ground of my hope
I cannot say that in fact it is always so
like a mosaic of a hundred thousand jewels
If you will allow me to prophesy
In saying this, I am not disposed to deny
Don't think too hard about it
Perhaps another reason why
I have endeavored to emphasize
She stood silent a moment, dropping before him like a broken branch
Love like a miser in the dark his joys would hide
It comes to this
The view I have been enforcing
I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative
Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster
It is a thing commonly said
Thus if you look into
Nay, it will be a relief to my mind
I say without fear of contradiction
I believe that in this instance
Noble and sublime patience
A sudden sense of fear ran through her nerves like the chill of an icy wind
While acknowledging the great value
His heart rebuked him
I can not help expressing a wish
In the world of letters
Like torrents from a mountain source, we rushed into each other's arms
Let me commend to you
I ask the audience to return with me
Organs of party rage and popular frenzy
The music of her delicious voice
Subtle as jealousy
Exuberant rush of words
A note of despairing appeal which fell
She seemed the embodiment of beauty
Amber is brighter than ruby
I saw his senses swim dizzy as clouds
It would be idle for me
It is wanton capriciousness
Now, I do not wish you to believe
As for the rest
The pageantry of sea and sky
The irresistible tendency of
I am firmly convinced
And there are reasons why
You are not consistent
The first counsel I would offer
You must be joking
Wrapped in scudding rain
Let us not be misunderstood
Every reader of history can recall
The animadversions of critics        [animadversions = Strong criticism]
In a state of nervous exacerbation
Judging without waiting to ponder over bulky tomes
Let this inspire us with abhorrence of
Cultivated with a commensurate zeal
We have witnessed on many occasions
As a man plowing all day longs for supper and welcomes sunset
It will be our aim to interest you
Any time that may suit your convenience
So you have a suitable stamp
I am thoroughly convinced
The stunning crash of the ocean saluted her
In any view of the case
A burning sense of shame and horror
Undoubtedly we may find
I speak what I know when I say
As the fair cedar, fallen before the breeze,
A carefully appraising eye
An indomitable and unselfish soul
                                    [meretricious = plausible but false]
Chafed at the restraints imposed on him
What a tempting prospect!
But I repeat
You overwhelm me with your kindness
Like an eagle clutching his prey, his arm swooped down
There is a question of vital importance
Your step's like the rain to summer vexed farmer
I note with particular pleasure
Red apples taste nicer than green
And quite as difficult is it to create
There is a common saying
An utter depression of soul
And it is precisely in this
A radiant look came over her face,
Another consideration which I shall adduce   [adduce = cite as an example]
In a vague and fragmentary way
We are always glad to furnish information
He gave himself to a sudden day-dream
By a curious irony of fate
He never wears an argument to tatters
As fatal as the fang of the most venomous snake
Like one who halts with tired wings
Please tell me why you did it
I simply pause here to ask
I shall not tax your patience
A hopeless enigma
I do not question for a moment
I have now rather more than kept my word
I was well pogged
Precipitated into mysterious depths of nothingness
The old ruddy conviction deserted me
Her face was dull as lead
Whatever the truth may be
All the butterflies had broad orange stripes
Almost incredible obtuseness
If there be any among us
There is another factor
Distressing in their fatuous ugliness
The fact has made a deep impression on me
Rays springing from the east like golden arrows
We trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention
One bright drop is like the gem that decks a monarch's crown
                               [propitious = favorable; kindly; gracious]
Yet it is instructive and interesting
                                      [mountebank = flamboyant charlatan]
All of us know
I feel the greatest satisfaction
It poured upon her like a trembling flood
It seems the height of absurdity
Habitual self-possession and self-respect
I mean it literally
The first great fact to remember is
The strident discord seemed to mock his mood
You know very well
An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate
The boat cuts its swift way through little waves like molten gold and opal
She seemed the embodiment of dauntless resolution
Stung by the splendor of the prospect
She had an air of restrained fury
A solemn utterance of destiny
Apparent rather than real
It may be imagined
The bank had treated me badly
Peevish and impatient, like some ill-trained man who is sick
I labor under a degree of prejudice
You have asked the impossible
In order to prove plainly and intelligibly
It is likewise necessary
We frankly apologize to you
I agree--at least, I suppose I do
There is no occasion to exaggerate
I am often reminded
I have been allowed the privilege
I might of course point first
We realize that this is simply an oversight on your part
She gave birth immediately
Obscured beneath the rubbish of the age
Like the long wandering love, the weary heart may faint for rest
Distinguish themselves by their eccentricities
I am not altogether clear
I lost myself in a reverie of gratitude
It seems to me unphilosophical
But besides these special facts
An indescribable frankness and simplicity of character
All these things you know
For one I deny
Unaware of her bitter taunt
Like the whole sky when to the east the morning doth return
Age, like winter weather
I rely on your good sense
The sky burned like a heated opal
Gone astray as a sheep that is lost
Exhibits itself in fastidious crotchets
You will have particular interest in the new and attractive policy
I thank you for having allowed me
                 [surreptitious = done by clandestine or stealthy means]
A mystery, soft, soothing and gentle, like the whisper of a child
What do you propose?
But while it may be admitted
The desolate rocky hills rolled like a solid wave along the horizon
Purged of glaringly offensive features
Do you believe this can be truthfully said
And in order to see this
I shall be interested to watch it develop
He was lost in a delirious wonder
I owe the idea wholly to you
Ought we not to think
It is surely necessary for me
Now, comparing these instances together
It is therefore evident
His face fell abruptly into stern lines
I have often a difficulty in deciding
Whatever opinion I may express
Surely that's immoral
In the air was the tang of spring
Eager with the headlong zest of a hunter for the game
It is impossible to avoid saying
Here we have it on high authority
Let me give one more instance
In saying all of this, I do not forget
And in the end, what are you going to make of it?
Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him
I should fail in my duty if
Her tongue stumbled and was silent
I must add my congratulations on your taste
He sacrificed the pleasures of life
The blanket is folded
We would appreciate a remittance
I was astonished to learn
There's nothing up my sleeve
The fox went ahead into the woods
And again, it is to be presumed
The raindrops were bigger than before
Let us, then, be worthy of
She kissed him passionately
It is a well known fact
Like a caged lion shaking the bars of his prison
Bearing on this point
Your statement is somewhat startling
It must be a matter of conjecture
A partial disenchantment
Provocative of bitter hostility
The eagerness faded from his eyes,
With the greatest esteem and respect
As foam from a ship's swiftness
Swifter than the twinkling of an eye
Permit me frankly to say
It sounds very alluring
We must profoundly revere it
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night they gathered
I wish it first observed
Criticized with unsparing vigor
The merest smattering of knowledge
Her blank gaze chilled you
It sounds profoundly interesting
Delicately emerging stars
The hinted sweetness of the challenge aroused him
It was torture of the most exquisite kind
A figure like a carving on a spire
I appeal to the better judgment
I want to interest you in this book
For my own part, I believe
It is merely a mood
A mind singularly practical and sagacious   [sagacious = wise]
An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy
This you can not deny
That is rather a difficult question to answer
We ought in strict propriety
He was an impulsive character
I know too well
You might make an exception
Instances might be multiplied indefinitely
One thing which always impressed me
Something amuses you
The mean and frivolous affections of the idle
A thin shrill voice like the cry of an expiring mouse
A face as pale as wax
In thanking you for the patronage with which you have favored us
The enchanting days of youth
An accidental encounter
It is amazing how little
At the suggestion of one of our patrons
The dumb forces of brute nature
The insipidity of indifference
We saw much hatred and loathing
Some of you will remember
An atmosphere of sunny gaiety
Full-throated as the sea
Her hurrying thoughts clamored for utterance
I should be the last man to deny
We are quite unable to speculate
I think your candor is charming
I proceed to another important phase
White as dove or lily, or spirit of the light
Reassure me, if you can
Cities that rise and sink like bubbles
Proclaimed with joyous defiance
I had occasion to criticize
What do you imagine my course should be?
Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion

However, I am viewing the matter
They amuse me immensely
Once more let me try to put into words
Pride and self-disgust served her
to make a pin instead of a pyramid
Teased with impertinent questions
I might reasonably question the justice
Suppose we turn our eyes to
I am trespassing too long on your time
This is the point of view
Free from all controversial pettifogging
Whatever a man thinks
It was my good fortune
The oscillations of human genius
Here we come into direct antagonism with
We write to suggest to you
Dim opalescence of the moon
Let us confirm our opinion
like those by sculptor graved for niches in a temple
Let anyone who doubts
The narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit
The fine flower of culture
A drowsy murmur floats into the air like thistledown
Please make yourself at home
Bring odium upon the individual
An old nodding negress whose sable head shined in the sun
It is not consistent with elevated and dignified character
The timely effusion of tearful sentiment
like a crushed herb
The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn
The three actors congratulated themselves
Set anew in some fresh and appealing form
Tears of outraged vanity blurred her vision
The wide horizon forever flames with summer
Mute as an iceberg
We particularly want to interest you
The days were fantastic
A skepticism which prompted rebellion
Dark as pitch
Were I to enter into a detailed description
Lax theories and corresponding practises
I pause for a moment to say
But I have been insisting simply
She scratched her ear
Everything seemed to be on the nose that day
I don't want to seem critical
Time like a pulse shakes fierce
He could do absolutely nothing
A half-breathless murmur of amazement and incredulity
I know many reasons why
In the perpetual presence of everlasting verities
Your logic is as clever as possible
It is an egregious mistake
I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome
No true man ever believes
As well try to photograph the other side of the moon
She was both weary and placated
I appreciate your motives
One or two points are made clear
I ask you gentlemen, do you think
A tremor of amusement was on his lips
Our letter must have gone astray
The indefinite atmosphere of an opulent nature
His limbs were disfigured
So much time was wasted by day-dreaming
But it is a fact
An abandoned and exaggerated grief
It must not be supposed
Furious as eagles
Like a star, his love's pure face looked down
struggled, surprised, through the mist and disappeared
Like the detestable and spidery araucaria
In a frenzy of fussy excitement
And now, to close, let me give you
Like a troop of boys let loose from school, the adventurers went by
The sea reeled round like a wine-vat splashing
But it does not follow from this
I hope I have expressed myself explicitly
In further illustration
Adhere too tenaciously to forms and modes
The victory was proclaimed with joyous defiance
I wish to draw your attention
Wield an unequaled and paramount authority
I sanction with all my heart
Eyes like mountain water that o'erflowing on a rock
Fleet as an arrow
How momentous, then
I hope you are interested
The gratification of ambition
Drift along the stream of fancy
The most reasonable anticipation
You will find the enclosed booklet very interesting
Quivering with restrained grief
We thank you very much for the frank statement of your affairs
Next, it will be denied
The computer is beige
If, then, I should here rest my cause
I thank you for your most generous greeting
A tedious and needless drudgery
Apparently I was wrong
It must be fascinating
LITERARY EXPRESSIONS
A most extraordinary idea!
The fatigue was showing
A long slit of daylight like a pointing finger
A transcript of the common conscience
The silence was uncomfortable and ominous
You should smile for the camera
Scrupulous morality of conduct
O
It is not wholly insignificant
Like a living meteor
In high good humor
A convenient makeshift
I think you are quibbling
With a vanquished and weary sigh
It hardly fits the character
Bear with me for a few moments
The accumulated bitterness of failure
Cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling
It was a golden summer
The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud
                                      [evanescent = vanishing like vapor]
The gesture was all strength and will,
An effusive air of welcome
I propose briefly to glance at
I feel entirely satisfied
Delicious throng of sensations
And, of course, you are aware
An icy indifference
Wayward and strangely playful responses
Soft as a zephyr
As fleeting and elusive as our dreams
A huge misunderstanding has occurred
That is not fair--to me
All the magic of youth and joy of life was there
Nature seemed to revel in contrasts
To the enormous majority of persons
The tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts
The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds
Love is a changing lord as the light on a turning sword
I am inclined sometimes to believe
It sounds rather appalling
I have a peculiar affection for it
A hand icily cold and clammy as death
A perfect crime of clumsiness
But how can we pass over
A sense of desolation and disillusionment overwhelmed me
I hate this ice cream
Under this head
Slack-minded skimming of newspapers
The tumult in her heart subsided
It was an evening that was wholly tranquil
Graceful succession of sentences
Incapable of initiative or boldness
An unpleasing strain, like the vibration of a rope drawn out too fast
Appreciably above the level of mediocrity
To be sedulously avoided             [sedulously = persevering]
Indeed, it will generally be found
More variegated than the skin of a serpent
Continuous as the stars that shine
At extreme tension, like a drawn bow
It is for others to illustrate
Like a glow-worm golden
Unamiable and envious attributes
We realize that this matter has escaped your attention
Endlessly shifting moods
This fact was soon made manifest
When we look closely at
I am deeply flattered and grateful
Are we wandering from the point?
Her face stiffened anew into a gray obstinacy
The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life
I will endeavor in a brief way
The most remarkable step forward
My belief, therefore, is
As an illustration of this truth
Strode forth imperiously   [imperious = arrogantly overbearing]
Notwithstanding all this, I hold
The rosy twilight of boyhood
I can not avoid confessing
It is only a few short years since
A great soul smitten and scourged,
The applause was unbounded
I think no Wise man can be indifferent
If I can be of further service, please address me
Yield to urgent representations
Bent on the lofty ends of her destiny
I am sorry to say it is impossible
I am only too sensible of the fact
Will it not be well for us
A random gleam of light broke through the line of trees
Immense objects which dwarf us
Dearer than night to the thief
He was totally silent
I would recommend to your consideration
Language is inadequate to voice my appreciation
She spoke with hurried eagerness
All this is very well
More than this need not be said
Regarded with sincere abhorrence
Conscious of unchallenged supremacy
Yes and no
These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm
The babbledom that dogs the heels of fame
I feel I have a right to say
I beg all to remember
No one can see the end
It depends upon circumstances
If you remain silent
Hard, sharp, and glittering as a sword
We are sorry to learn from your letter
You cannot regret more than I the necessity
out to receive the record of her toil
Let your imagination realize
This is not all
Recollect, sir
It depends on how you look at it
A lingering tinge of admiration
I must bow in reverence
A soundless breeze that was little more than a whisper
A daily avalanche of vituperation
And so I might recount to you
These last words lead me to say
Lovely beyond all words
I feel a great necessity to
Lingering like an unloved guest
The Spring breaks like a bird
I am sensible, sir
I am not a stranger to
There were nights of fathomless blackness
I herewith submit my application
If I wished to prove my contention
Fulsome praise, I call it
The villa dips its foot in the lake, smiling at its reflection
It would take too long to formulate my thought
Revenge is often sweeter than appeasement
It was an answering show of gratitude
Rather loquacious, I think        [loquacious = very talkative]
As some one has well said
We are bound to give heed
Seriously, then, do I beg you
I had better begin at the beginning
Wearing the white flower of a blameless life
As chimney sweepers come to dust
You look incredulous
The pressure of accumulated misgivings
It is an easy matter
We trust you may secure some of the exceptional values
Thanking you in advance for an early reply
Who will accuse me
I have a dark suspicion
A charming air of vigor and vitality
I do not recount all
Believing you will answer this promptly
many fields had been pressed between giant's fingers and so had been left
Me on whose heart as a worm she trod
A super-abundance of boisterous animal spirits
Likely enough
The eager pretentiousness of youth
A whole whirlpool of various emotions
Salutary tonic of a free current of public criticism
Pressing cares absorbed him
He sat on the thorns
Cynically repudiate all obligations
It is very common to confuse
Subtle indications of great mental agitation
Hence, as I have said
Moreover, I would counsel you
It was certainly a gracious act
I well recollect the time
Flitted like a sylph on wings
It is needful to a complete understanding
We are merely wasting energy in this duel
Great scarlet poppies lay in drifts and heaps,
A cluster of stars hangs like fruit in the tree
Precisely, that is just what I meant
It's the natural sequence
He was bold as the hawk
Infuse a wholesome terror
And Dusk, with breast as of a dove, brooded

An answering glow of gratitude
In conclusion, we can assure you
Violent and unforeseen vicissitudes
I shall never cease to be grateful
A lively sense of what is dishonorable
A name which sounds even now like the call of a trumpet
Assailed by poignant doubts
It is no small indication
The deep like one black maelstrom round her whirls
It is comparatively easy
Grace and gentleness of manner
This personal guarantee I look upon as a service to you
As full of eager vigor as a mountain stream
Quickened into a stabbing suspicion
My mind is not moved by
He let out an expression of mildly humorous surprise
And it is well that this should be so
Looming large and ugly in the public view
And is there not a presumption
I should like your opinion of it
It was a fine and delicate rebuke
The rigor of the law
Still, you might make an exception
Sunny silence broods over the realm of little cottages
I do not contend
Patience under continual provocation
A glittering infectious smile
I make no extravagant claim
But I return to the question
And now I beg that I may be permitted
The cushious were softer than the carpet
I have sometimes asked myself
I have the greatest possible confidence
You have not forgotten
I do not mean now to go further than
I mention this, not by way of complaint
It is not to me so very surprising
The veneer of a spurious civilization
The freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea
Imprisoned within an enchanted circle
Fragments of most touching melody
Prodigal of discriminating epithets
Chicken soup will help to cure anything
It is only just to say
Thoughts which mock at human life
For is it not true
I quite see what the advantages are
The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills
My body broken as a turning wheel
He named his rabbit after his teacher
He was most loathsome
It is impossible to resist acknowledging this
Like a bright window in a distant view
As beautiful as the purple flush of dawn
It will interest you to know the football score
This episode goes to prove
Wits as sharp as gimlets     [gimlet = small hand tool for boring holes]
We have no other alternative
Suddenly and imperatively summoned
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
Clearly enough
I hope you will forgive an intruder
I do not absolutely assert
In accordance with the terms of our offer
It is exceedingly gratifying to hear
It will be recollected
I am lost in admiration
We are thoroughly convinced of the need
I will ask you to bear witness
But, wait, you haven't heard the end
There was a thrill in the air
I do not know with what correctness
Her heels were hurting
Much has been said and written about
To speak frankly, I do not like it
I sorrowfully call to mind
Doubtless the end is sought
A hotbed of disturbance
Like building castles in the air
As dumb as a fish
The day have trampled me like armed men
It happened in an instant
Do me the honor of believing
It is indeed a strange doctrine
I think it may be necessary to consider
I am compelled to inform you of your brother's ill health
I think we may well be proud of
But delusions and phantasmagoria
Any information you may give us will be appreciated
And eyes as bright as the day
Summer clouds floated overhead
He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets
I ask your attention
This is a great idea
Like a star that dwelt apart
Till death like sleep might steal on me
But it is no use protesting
In that mood of high hope
Her face was like a light
Of course you will sympathize
Imbued with a vernal freshness       [vernal = resembling spring; fresh]
We saw youth and age together
You're taking it all much too seriously
We hope that an understanding can be reached
Fade away like a cloud in the horizon
Clear as crystal
On occasions of this kind
Gleam like a diamond on a dancing girl
Far off and incredibly remote
I do not hesitate to say
I return you my most grateful thanks
And how am I to thank you?
A sharp pang of regretful surprise
When we consider the vastness
Like a voice from the unknown regions
These points should be most carefully considered
I will enlarge no further
The dawn with silver-sandaled feet crept like a frightened girl.
Nor can we forget how long
If there is any valid reason why you are unable
The vanishing thoughtlessness of youth
as though driven to their land of shadows by shuddering fear
Suggestive sagacity and penetration      [sagacity = farsighted; wise]
I am compelled to inform you
The girl's voice rang like a bird-call through his rustling fancies
I ask the attention
Upon the mountain-tops of meditation
The freshening breeze struck his brow with a cooling hand
Purple, crimson, and scarlet, like the curtains of God's tabernacle
Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage
Like the kiss of maiden love the breeze is sweet and bland
A pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn
Like the jangling of all the strings of some musical instrument
I am fully convinced
We shall be glad to fill your order
We can assure you that any order with which you favor us
Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree
You have my unbounded confidence
It is hardly necessary to pass judgment
The flabbiness of our culture
In former ages and generations
This love that dwells like moonlight in your face
All this is historical fact
Like a moral lighthouse in the midst of a dark and troubled sea
In all times and places
I have found great cause for wonder
A homelike and festive aspect
   shaking out their perfume as from a swung censer
I have no scruple in saying
They are as white foam on the swept sands
I most certainly agree with you
Now, it is evident
A mouth of inflexible decision
I will neither affirm nor deny
I am curious to learn what his motive was
Some writer has said
Thwarted by seeming insuperable obstacles
like the genii from the earthen pot
A soft insidious plea
It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary
Difficult then as the question may be
He bowed and she curtsied
I will illustrate this point by
Of course these remarks hold good
like aged dogs wondering why no one takes them for a walk
out of the green-gold air
A great capacity for generous indignation
I have lately observed many strong indications
Just trust to the inspiration of the moment
Choked by the thorns and brambles of early adversity
Be assured, then
Glowing with haste and happiness
Under no circumstances can I agree to this
Without going into any details
Balmy in manner as a bland southern morning
I do not speak exclusively
Her mind was beaten to the ground by the catastrophe
Will it be whispered
Like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm
D
Tempered by the emotional warmth of high moral ideals
Bright as the sunbeams
The canal boat travels slowly along the canal
the near presence of people who are distasteful
Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun
I have been profoundly moved
An essentially grotesque and commonplace thing
Censured for his negligence
As if a door were suddenly left ajar into some world unseen before
I might bring you another such case
I ask permission to speak to you
I think we should do well to call to mind
The gloomy insolence of self-conceit
The first recoil from her disillusionment
I submit this proposition
like to a child o'erwearied with sweet toil
The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world
Ride like the wind through the night
Commended by perfect suavity
And next I would ask
In the fullness of time
I wish to remind you in how large a degree
Extraordinarily subtle and penetrating analysis
In a wider sense
A soft suspicion of ulterior motives
A thousand evanescent memories of happy days
An ecstasy which suddenly overwhelms your mind like
It is a huge undertaking
I ask that you be good enough
The pleasing duty is assigned me
The tide was in the salt-weed, and like a knife it tore
It is often very misleading
But it will perhaps be argued
It is rather startling
Few indeed there are
In a most impressive vein
In a state of mulish reluctance      [mulish = stubborn and intractable]
For if any one thinks that there is
You shock me more than I can say
If it means anything, it means this
The moon is waning below the horizon
To prosecute a scheme of personal ambition
Well done! I congratulate you
I leave it to you
Fatally and indissolubly united
Hitherto I have spoken only of
We saw the gray rim of the sea
Lapse into pathos and absurdity
The presence of this brilliant assemblage
The infirmity and fallibility of human nature
I can not let this opportunity pass
Power always corrupts and it always will
I wonder how much truth there is in it?
He was utterly detached from life
The army blazed and glowed in the golden sunlight
The hungry curiosity of the mind
I do not exactly understand you
In the backpack was a blanket
I am not going into vexed questions
In the mild and mellow maturity of age we see things differently
Nothing remained but a graceful acquiescence
Time had passed unseen
Instances abound
It is the universal testimony
We have heard lately
The time has manifestly now arrived
A calm and premeditated prudence
Incited by a lust for gain
I should much prefer
The artificial smile of languor
Deep essentials of moral grandeur
I trust that I shall have the indulgence
Now, I am obliged to say
His conscience leapt to the light
The land was like a dream
What a curious coincidence!
Sometimes I venture to think
the red, rejoicing blood began to race
I am happy to be with you
You have been gracious enough to assign to me
You remember how
Thank you for your expression of confidence
And now it would be very pleasant for me
The evening sky was as green as jade
Its dominating and inspiring influence
I am about to supplement
Words sweet as honey from his lips distill'd
Labored and far-fetched elocution
Like a rocket discharging a shower of golden stars
The Milky Way lay like diamond-dust upon the robe of some great king
I like your frankness
Upbraid ourselves with folly
I have not the least doubt of it
We are unable to grant your request
A violent and mendacious tongue              [mendacious = false; untrue]
As though Pharaoh should set the Israelites
The sweet indulgence of good-nature
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk
Add this instance to
The path is covered with moss
It has been justly objected
I have nothing more to say
What very kind things you say to me
I have lived to see
We desire information pertaining to your financial condition
An envious wind crept by like an unwelcome thought
I shall make a point of thinking so
A snare and a delusion
For, perhaps, after all
It is all very well for you to be philosophical
But this is a digression
The hammer and sickle were still there
Again, let us compare
                     [calumnies = maliciously false statements; slander]
The breeze is as a pleasant tune
Her weariness caused her to slip down the waterfall
like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven
I have labored to maintain
I stand in the midst of men
It is true
Haunt the recesses of the memory
Irregulated and desultory education     [desultory = haphazard; random]
What a frosty winter
The prophecies of visionaries and enthusiasts
The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white-winged geese
Like the dim scent in violets
like a haunting perfume of pressed flowers
The sun lay golden-soft over the huddled hills
Marvelously suggestive and inspiring
She permitted herself a delicate smile
Like having to taste a hundred exquisite dishes in a single meal
A numerous company
Don't delude yourself
the stab of a dagger of ice frozen from a poisoned well
Like some grave night thought threading a dream
I shall not hesitate to say something
The words of the wise fall
Shall I tell you
This exquisite conjunction and balance
Strange frankness of cynical brutality
The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance
A kind of ineffable splendor crowns the day
I fancy I hear you say
There are two conflicting theories
A fitting interval for penitence
I am unable to understand
There is certainly no reason
It was the ecstasy of summer
Her lips parted in a keen expectancy
In the presence of this vast assembly
When music is allied to words
The day was at once redolent and vociferous
The remark was sternly uncompromising
I might try to explain
It was inevitable that you should say that
It is difficult to overstate
We do not quarrel with those
And now, sir, what I had first to say
It is to you that I am indebted for all this
She danced like a flower in the wind
I ask the audience
In offering to you these counsels
Rigid and exact boundaries
We can't stem the tide of opinion
I know not where else to find
Breathed like a sea at rest
Like an unseen star of birth
In the mild and mellow maturity of age
There is no good reason
An atmosphere thick with flattery and toadyism
The sky was turning to the pearly gray of dawn
Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness
Old happy hours that have long folded their wings
The climax of my purpose in this address
I am certain that you will give me credit
Sharp outbursts of hatred and bitterness
I confess to you that I have no fear
Roared like mountain torrents
He had a wise, superior, slightly scornful manner
The insolence of power
Your voice had a quaver in it just like the linnet   [linnet = small finch]
It is easy to understand
Life flowed in its accustomed stream
It is a matter of great regret to us
Silence now is brooding
Allow me to tell a story
Borne with a faculty of willing compromise
The clustered apples burnt like flame
Calm like a flowing river
Disguised itself as chill critical impartiality
His tone assumed a certain asperity   [asperity = roughness; harshness]
I can only congratulate you
He glanced at her indulgently
It is unnecessary for me to remind you
The dawn is rising from the sea, like a white lady from her bed
like water bubbling from a silver jar?
I stand corrected
Easy as a poet's dream
She looked like a tall golden candle
Lovely the land unknown and like a river flowing
She was exquisitely simple
Like a tide of triumph through their veins,
If you smoke you are sure to die
Now, I am far from undervaluing
It is observable enough
Again, in this view
Arrayed with scrupulous neatness
Grant this true
The ties of a common cause
As impossible as to count the stars in illimitable space
Oh, do not form an erroneous impression
I take pleasure in saying
He could do absolutely naught
The crowning touch of pathos
Less than this could not be said
Let us heed the voice
The tribute of affectionate applause
She was struck by a sudden curiosity
But do you imagine
Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend
Fitful tumults of noble passion
It is a mischievous notion
like the tolling of sweet, grave bells upon the soul
But perhaps you are not yet weary
Slowly as the finger of a clock, her shadow came
We are told emphatically
A touch of exquisite pathos
In view of these reflections
If singing fails, then dance
Be like the granite of thy rock-ribbed land
It was the middle of the summer
Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child
Checked by the voice of authority
You astonish me greatly
We shall heartily appreciate any information
Unutterably trivial and paltry
Fanciful and extravagant as a caliph's dream
An early reply will greatly oblige
The earth looked despoiled
The heights of magnanimity and love
He spoke intimately with her
He writhed in the grip of the giant spider
Of one thing, however, I am certain
I shall not acknowledge
In like manner I would advise
I would urge and entreat you
Too preposterous for belief
Like the faint cry of unassisted woe
Dimly foreshadowed on the horizon
We want particularly to impress upon you this fact
Shrill as the loon's call
I must proceed
Such, sir, I conceive to be
I am at your service
I could do no less than
We have not yet solved the problem
Like Heaven's free breath, which he who grasps can hold not
He turned on me a glance of stored intelligence
The first whiff of reality dissipated them like smoke
But again, when we carefully consider
At the risk of digression
An avidity that bespoke at once the restlessness,   [avidity = eagerness]
T
I shall touch upon one or two questions
He was measured and urbane
Surely you sound too harsh a note
Absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night
The retreating splendor of autumn
What is more important
In a kind of confused astonishment
Like organ music came the deep reply
Thy carven columns must have grown by magic, like a dream in stone
Do you press me to tell?
You are a profound philosopher
Think of the cool disregard
I seriously desire
           [captious = disposition to find and point out trivial faults]
It remains only to speak briefly
A disheveled and distraught figure
when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber
I am not bold enough to
Oh, that was a manner of speaking
Peddling and pitiful compromises
Her cheeks were wan and her eyes like coals
Fate had turned and twisted a thousand ways
She lingered a few seconds more
As nimble as water
A potion to be delicately supped at leisure
Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote
You will forgive me
I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew
Leave to the imagination the endless vista of possibilities
I ask you to consider
A great moon like a red lamp in the sycamore
But if I seek for illustrations
Pale and grave as a sculptured nun
Such things as the eye of history sees
Nor need we fear to speak
Some of you may think this visionary
In contemplating the causes
Some people are impervious to the lessons of experience
A great many people have said
Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master
It was terrifying
It follows as a matter of course
If I were disposed to offer counsel
His hand supported his chin
I submit it to every candid mind
His eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry
A steady babble of talk and laughter
All I ask is
It has at all times been a just reproach
I should like to go a step farther
It is for me to relate
The high-bred pride of an oriental
Lucidity and argumentative vigor
I suffered agonies of shyness
Political storm and stress.
I suppose most men will recollect
Thus my imagination tells me
A well-bred mixture of boldness and courtesy
We have had some conclusions in common
Frankly, I prefer the purple car
The tune of moving feet in the lamplit city
What remains but to wish you
An obnoxious member of society
It is certainly remarkable
It is not so unreasonable as you think
She shall be sportive as the fawn
like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail
A memory-haunting phrase
Startling leaps over vast gulfs of time
I confess it is very difficult to
I should welcome an interview at your convenience
like shapes breathed on a mirror and melting away
It would not seem an improbable conclusion
Please think about it
Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention
That is very felicitous
A sort of eager, almost appealing amiability
Like the vase in which roses have once been distill'd
Uttering grandiose puerilities     [puerilities = childishness, silly]
Before attempting to answer this question
The lowest grade of precarious mendacity     [mendacity = untruthfulness]
I am sometimes inclined to think
I have often lingered in fancy
That is rather a strange request to make
Profound and chilling solitude of the spot
Thus far, I willingly admit
But grave problems confront us
And when I recall that event
And so in the present case
Like a miser who spoils his coat with scanting a little cloth
I am very glad of this opportunity
Credulous and emotionally extravagant
There are those who wish
Let us not flatter ourselves
Like one pale star against the dusk,
I have gazed with admiration
Will you kindly advise us in order that we may adjust our records
He looked with the bland, expressionless stare of an overgrown baby
A very formidable problem
Denominational lines like stone walls
Creeds like robes are laid aside
An act of folly amounting to wickedness
It's so kind of you to come
It pealed through her brain like a muffled bell
He lay like a warrior taking his rest
Notwithstanding all that has been said
Worthless like the conjurer's gold
Are you prepared to go to that length?
I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment
As I dropped like a bolt from the blue
He ruled autocratically
But now look at the effect
The hall-mark of a healthy humanity
Vain allurements of folly and fashion
Quibbling, I call it
So much the better for me
A cunning intellect patiently diverting every circumstance to its design
His heart asserted itself again, thunderously beating
A piece of grotesque stupidity
An insatiable voracity
I am not catching at sharp arguments
Observe again
A swift knowledge came to her
A synonym for retrogression
Evinces a hardened conscience and an insensibility to shame
How much more rational it would be
And at first the road comes moving toward me, like a bride waving palms
Never can I cease to feel
Depend upon it
Something stifling and over-perfumed
An undisciplined state of feeling
Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, flushing his brow
I earnestly maintain
We offer you the services of an expert
Such are the rather tolerant ideas
Let me now conclude with
Like scents from a twilight garden
I have had steadily in mind
He danced like a man in a swarm of hornets
This leads me to the question
Yielding to a wave of pity
That provoked him to action
That is far from my thoughts
Generally speaking
Involuntarily she sighed
A ghastly whiteness spread over her cheek
I suppose we are all of one opinion
It was so dreary
We trust that we may hear favorably from you
Everyone looks at it differently
Does not the nature of every man revolt
Y
I believe I shall make it clear to you
There is some difference of opinion
Skulking beneath a high-sounding benevolence
I rise to express my disapprobation   [approbation = warm approval; praise]
But I can promise
Nor can we now ask
Like a great express train, roaring, flashing, dashing head-long
And thus it seems to me
The bus was later than usual
What a beautiful idea
We have the honor to inform you
These various partial views
It is very far from being a fiction
I must not for an instant be supposed
As weird as the elfin lights
A fever of enthusiasm
As austere as a Roman matron
True, there are difficulties
Something eminently human beaconed from his eyes
He frowned repeatedly
A gambler's desperate chance
Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable
There is no field of human activity
Is it logically consistent
He perceived the iron hand within the velvet glove
Well, I'm not going to argue that
This may be said without prejudice
A little breeze ran through the corn
While we appreciate the peculiar circumstances
Supreme arbiter of conduct
The ships, like sheeted phantoms coming and going
And now, to what purpose do I mention
The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor
The plenitude of her piquant ways     [piquant = engagingly stimulating]
The dome of heaven is like one drop of dew
The complaining gate swung open
He sent an email immediately
Fugitive felicities of thought and sensation
The earth contains six continents
In conclusion, let me say
A glance of extraordinary meaning
Sadness prevailed among her moods
I do not enter into the question
A subtle emphasis of scorn
Broke in a stupendous roar upon the shuddering air
Like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings,
I know there are some who think
All my life broke up, like some great river's ice at touch of spring
I know you will do all in your power
Cut the shape from the cardboard
I make this abrupt acknowledgment
It is merely common sense to say
Q
We can not too highly honor the temper of
Like a long arrow through the dark the train is darting
We admit that you are justified in your complaint
The stars seemed attentive
I will think of it, since you wish it
You are very courteous
The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power
He braced himself
The doctrine is admirable
She was gripped with a sense of suffocation and panic
That is very amiable in you
Every one therefore ought to look to
For it is not right to
He took his courage in both hands
Let us hope that future generations
I am alarmed, indeed, when I see
Well, I confess they don't appeal to me
He frowned perplexedly
Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric
A unique and overwhelming charm
On the occasion to which I refer
Like a murmur of the wind came a gentle sound of stillness
I bemoaned my unlucky fate
A theme of endless meditation
But let us also keep ever in mind
It is a noble thing
You are as gloomy to-night as an undertaker out of employment
A slowly subsiding frenzy
The most sublime instance that I know
That is certainly ideal
When I review these circumstances
We are in a position to give you considerable help
The fragrance of a dear and honored name
In my estimation
The eternal questioning of inscrutable fate
Your tongue is like a scarlet snake
Do you realize that you can do almost anything
The unbroken habit of a lifetime
Like a summer-dried fountain
Few subjects are more fruitful
I am giving the matter my personal attention
A supposed ground of affinity
A river of shame swept over him
It is not my purpose to discuss
But I am certain from my own experience
We acknowledge with pleasure the receipt of your order
Can you yield yourselves
He drank of the spirit of the universe
The air was caressed with song
Through the moonlit trees, like ghosts of sounds haunting the moonlight,
And, sir, a word
They felt a curious and inexplicable uneasiness
The confusing assertion is sometimes made
If I could find words
Unfortunately I must decline the proposal
The welcome that has been extended to me
Running to and fro like frightened sheep
But is this any reason why
Universal in their signification
It is this which lies at the foundation
I was sincerely astonished
We thank you for your kind inquiry of recent date
A mere exhibition of fussy diffuseness
Dip your toe in the water
And so, upon every hand
We heard a steady babble of talk and laughter
On such a day as this
Your opinion will be invaluable to me
Beneath a sky as fair as summer flowers
How may we serve you further?
It is a remarkable and striking fact
Mysterious and invincible darkness
This was my most treasured friendship
Omitting all compliments and commonplaces
Like a pageant of the Golden Year, in rich memorial pomp the hours go by
We had better agree to differ
Your charms lay like metals in a mine
I assert, sir, that it is
Insensibility to moral perspective and proportion
I repeat my statement in another form
Swift as a swallow heading south
But in making this assertion
Womanly fickleness and caprice
If I may reverently say so
The satire of the word cut like a knife
an unexpected and exquisite thought
One by one flitting like a mournful bird
A spacious sense of the amplitude of life's possibilities
Unhampered by binding alliances
There was no sense of diminution
Let us observe this analogy
We have here plain proof
He submitted in brooding silence
He had never seen a brighter blue carpet
But even admitting these possibilities
A shimmer of golden sun was shaking through the trees
I need scarcely observe
You may be sure of my confidence
Drop like a feather, softly to the ground
Really--you must go?
One gracious fact emerges here
And therefore it is not without regret
I do not say anything about the future
Torn asunder by eternal strife
The royal arrogance of youth
I think what you say is reasonable
Her haughty step waxed timorous and vigilant
I think we need neither doubt nor fear
This is my favorite music
In the first place we see
Her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom
It was a spectacular display of wealth
Reboot the computer now
Over and over the thoughts took over her mind
I am surprised, I confess
The heckling began
Now, I will undertake to say
You could smell the strange sweet odor
Debased by common use
I must pause a moment to
But the final value
Mentality as hard as bronze
A voice of matchless compass and eloquence
Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind
The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way
In the dim procession of years
Hers was the loveliness of some tall white lily cut in marble,
There are, I believe, many who think
I am directed to say to you
That is the lesson of history
Inspirited by approval and applause
Being fully of the opinion
I can not feel any doubt myself
A grim and shuddering fascination
Like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
I am totally at a loss to conceive
Remembering some past occurrences
I shall feel highly honored
Prodigious boldness and energy of intellect
A man of matchless modesty and refinement
We regret the necessity of calling your attention
Her impulse came and went like fireflies in the dusk
Endowed with life and emphasis
As innocent as a new laid egg
The foe of excess and immoderation
Sore beset by the pressure of temptation
An imperturbable demeanor and steadiness of mind
And a pinnace like a flutter'd bird came flying from afar
How does the idea appeal to you?
I can explain the apparent contradiction
It is not a practical question
Dine with me to-morrow night?--if you are free?
It is eminently proper
He drew near to a desperate resolve
We often hear persons say
The point I wish a little further to speak of
Let us thank you again for opening an account with us
I was in a somber mood
A reversion to the boldest paganism
This sentence has five words
I am familiar with
We trust our explanation will meet with your approval
You really insist upon it?
We assure you of our desire to be of service
I see little hope of
It is my present purpose
Certainly, one can conceive
The honeysuckle was taking over the garden
With music sweet as love
Reeling headlong in luxury and sensuality
I know there is a theory among us
Like sunlight, in and out the leaves, the robins went
The crimson close of day
Lest the requirements of courtesy be disregarded
The torrent from the hills
Crude undigested masses of suggestion
I think it will be granted
I fervently trust
I can not say how glad I am
And it is one of the evidences
Inimical to true and determined principle   [Inimical =  harmful; adverse]
What I now say is
It runs counter to all established customs
I must ask you one more question, if I may
Palpably and unmistakably commonplace
I ask this of you
The mind was filled with a formless dread
A murderous tenacity about trifles
From the circumstances already explained
It should be remembered
They were all deeply reticent
It is a mistake to suppose
I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you
This being the case
The inevitable climax and culmination
A mere conjectural estimate
Variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression
I have shown
I am here the advocate of
Rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel
Thanking you for your inquiry
I particularly allude to
It is indeed not a little remarkable
In the present situation
Involving ourselves in embarrassments
I was overwhelmed
                              [augury = sign of something coming; omen]
Kindle the flames of genuine oratory
I have no prejudice on the subject
It remains that I inform you of
I conceive this to be
Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently
In closing my speech, I ask each of you
Deep as the fathomless sea
The book was a mere figment of his imagination
Large, dark, luminous eyes that behold everything about them
A free press is essential
But this is a circuitous argument
A campaign of unbridled ferocity
Under no circumstances can we entertain such an arrangement
I am bold to say
He murmured a vague acceptance
Can the long records of humanity teach us
The afternoon was waning
Let us know if there is any further attention
A sense of repression was upon her
It is our duty to examine
I hadn't thought of it in that light
A new doubt assailed her
I don't deny that it is interesting
I will give one more illustration
It must be very gratifying to you
Allow me for a moment to turn to
A thing of as frail enchantment as the gleam of stars upon snow
His eyes shone with the pure fire of a great purpose
The palest abstractions of thought
I lay it down as a principle
Versed in the arts of exciting tumult and sedition
I would infinitely rather
The presage of disaster was in the air
Supported by a splendid fearlessness
Very strange is this indeed
Is it sane--is it reasonable?
All this we take for granted
But thou art fled, like some frail exhalation
We have a right to claim
On this point I do not mean to dwell
I open the all-important question
Fluttered like gilded butterflies in giddy mazes
He ruled autocratically
All was instinctive and spontaneous
There is only one sense in which
I meant what I said in my letter
My heart is as some famine-murdered land
There is another remarkable analogy
An eternity of silence oppressed him
This is only another illustration of
I shall respect your confidence
Another point is made as clear as crystal
Do not think me guilty of
Silence fell
It is almost proverbial
A shrewd eye to the main chance
It is interesting to know
I am here to introduce
Like a thing read in a book or remembered out of the faraway past
I am, indeed, most solicitous
Your good sense must tell you
I deem it both necessary and just
Haunted by blank misgivings
The flight of the autumnal days
I purposely have avoided
But with these exceptions
The unsophisticated period of youth
But yet nothing can be more splendid
Quite destitute of resources
A majority of us believe
And now I go back to the statement
And now consider
Your further orders will be esteemed
For instance, I can fancy
Lights and shadows of reviving memory crossed her face
Let our object be
Dream a little dream for me
Eyes like deep wells of compassionate gloom
The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean
Let us assure you that we are very much pleased
What strikes the mind so forcibly
We would consider it a great favor
It needed calm and premeditated prudence
But passing these by
It sometimes seems to me
It is very interesting and pleasant
The little incident seemed to throb with significance
A confused mass of impressions, like an old rubbish-heap
We must not expose ourselves to misinterpretation
Fictitious and adventitious aid
The gray air rang and rippled with lark music
You may be acquainted with
I am wholly in agreement with you
G
I can not allow myself to believe
Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep
Distract and beguile the soul
Vanished like vapor before the sun
I am confirming that I will attend your wedding
The strongest proof I have
Scorched with the lightning of momentary indignation
It seems an age since we've last seen you
A conscientious anxiety to do the right thing
It should always be borne in mind
To be more explicit
I will not condescend to
Dip and surge lightly to and fro, like the red harbor-buoy
We hear no complaint
His temper was dark and explosive
I want to say to you seriously
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
You gave me such chill embraces
Look at it in another way
As delicate and as fair as a lily
Words and acts easily wrenched from their true significance
There ought certainly to be
The frustration of their dearest hopes
Here, then, it is natural at last
I cheerfully submit myself
There are special circumstances
He was aware of emotion
A less revolutionary innovation
A dazzling completeness of beauty
With hate darkling as the swift winter hail
The subtle emanation of other influences seemed to arrest and chill him
And therefore am I truly glad
I recollect hearing a sagacious remark    [sagacious = sound judgment]
Let our conception be enlarged
Gratuitous and arbitrary meddling
We have need to examine
Do you realize that you can
Plumbing the depth of my own fears
Nor is it probable
He accosted me with trepidation
ran through the green and gold of pasture lands
Will you be more explicit?
I hope you continue your interesting performance
The mountains loomed up dimly, like phantoms through the mist
The irrevocable past and the uncertain future
Do not let us conceal from ourselves
I have taken pains to know
An ennobling and invigorating influence
It's deliciously honest
Every curve of her features seemed to impress
We again thank you for your inquiry
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid
Fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky
How well you do it!
I will even express a hope at the outset
Reading between the lines
This was the most surprising thing of all
Platitudinous and pompously sentimental
The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy
PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES
I ought to give an illustration
It is idle to think of
His pulses leaped anew
Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in
Certainly, with the greatest pleasure
Faintly, like a falling dew
This appeal to the common sense
She took refuge in a passionate exaggeration of her own insufficiency
His hand supported his chin
A sad inquiry seemed to dwell in her gaze
To illustrate
You are unduly distressing yourself
Transparent like a shining sun
They have as many principles as a fish has bones
There are some slight modifications
We feel sure that you will approve of our action in this matter
His face torn with conflict
     [redolent = emitting fragrance; aromatic; suggestive; reminiscent]
And everybody here knows
It is of no moment
Aghast at his own helplessness
There are some who have an idea
In the course of these remarks
like a child catching an older person in a foolish statement
A state of urgent necessity
I mention these facts because
Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms
It stung like a frozen lash
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
Undeniably true
A conspicuous and crowning service
You are now invited to do honor
Still another encouraging fact
It will not be expected from me
Pruned of their excrescences and grotesque extremes
The strong hand of executive authority
In examining this part of the subject
I would as soon believe
Flap loose and slack like a drooping sail
Soft as sleep the snow fell
I want to bespeak your attention
He felt an unaccountable loathing
It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances
I have one step farther to go
Unforced and unstudied depth of feeling
Swift as lightning
Noble and sublime patience
It is all very well to say
The next point is
In a gale of teasing merriment
I think that I can explain
They stand like solitary mountain forms
The sentiment is worthy of you
May I ask to whom you allude?
Lastly, it can not be denied
I see no exception
It was not unkindly meant
I thank you very sincerely for the honor
The sentiment to which I am to respond
The music and mystery of the sea
With the whisper of leaves in one's ear
An expression of mildly humorous surprise
Deafening and implacable as some elemental force
and all the earth revealeth
I recognize the high compliment conveyed
Uttering wild cries like a creature in pain
A sentiment of distrust in its worth had crept into her thoughts
It so happens
I wish I had the time and the power
Joy showed in his large dark eyes
It is often remarked
I would not be understood as belittling
I am led on by these reflections
Drear twilight of realities
I am sorry to interrupt this interesting discussion
Like fixed eyes, whence the dear light of sense and thought has fled
Ruffling out his cravat with a crackle of starch,
Still I can not part from my subject
That is very curious
The prime of man has waxed like cedars
I will answer you frankly
Idle hopes, like empty shadows
He had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honor
What you propose is utterly impossible
I would not push the suggestion so far
Wrought of an emotion infectious and splendidly dangerous
But not for one moment
Such illustrations are not frequent
We should contemplate and compare
Like a cloud of fire
Please favor us with a personal communication
I willingly admit
Do not the circumstances justify it?
Darkness oozed out from between the trees
Referring to your esteemed favor
I do not mean anything so absurd
He was discreetly silent
We shall be indebted to you for your courtesy
It is evident that the answer to this
The easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker
There is a very common tendency
Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul
Like iridescent bubbles floating on a foul stream
But this is not all
Couched in terms of feigned devotion
Like laying a burden on the back of a moth
Nevertheless we can admit
Before I close I will particularly remark
It is a memory I cherish
Fit closely together as the close-set stones of a building
Upon receiving your letter of
His lips loosened in a furtively exultant smile
It held a grim and shuddering fascination
At the same time, I candidly state
He paid his accountant
There are, indeed, persons who profess
More or less severe and prolonged
The idea was utterly hateful and repugnant
Eternal as the skies
It was suffocating slowly
You and I are always contrasting
This leads us to inquire
Brute terrors like the scurrying of rats in a deserted attic
He was a callous brute
Like Death, who rides upon a thought,
I might go on to illustrate
Dark and deep as night
Will you give us the benefit of your experience
I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate
I will not pretend to inquire into
May I speak freely?
I do not propose to take up your time
I can not but reflect
Can we pretend
Dreams that fade and die in the dim west
If I am asked for the proof
Fine precision of intent
Again, it is quite clear that
He thought he remembered her
She mulled it over for ages
In that head of his a flame burnt that was like an altar-fire
May the day come quickly
Such was the petty chronicle
The tediousness of inactivity
With all the complacency of a homeless cat
The sheer weight of unbearable loneliness
Here let me meet one other question
But surely, you can not say
She was the echo in his heart
They have faces like flowers
A mind very like a bookcase
Black as a foam-swept rock
And if I take another instance
A prey to listless uneasiness
We regret that we are not in a position
This is a general statement
All sorts of petty tyrannies
A light of unwonted pleasure in her eyes         [unwonted = unusual]
For this is what I say
And if you come to a decision
like a gentle spirit o'er the still and pulseless world
The primitive instinct of self-preservation
It is not by any means
It will not, I trust, be concluded
What we are concerned to know is
Are we forever to deprive ourselves
I insist upon it
Little white hands like pearls
Joy rioted in his large dark eyes
Give me your sympathy and counsel
Her bright eyes were triumphant
Agreeable and humanizing intercourse
Like all citizens of high ideals
It will be entirely satisfactory to us
Now, we will inquire
For your convenience we enclose a stamped envelope
Thrilled with a sense of strange adventure
There is an analogy in this respect
The cave was full of possible danger
This is the meaning of
Recently we had occasion to celebrate
My heart is like a full sponge and must weep a little
Does it seem incredible?
We remain, gentlemen, with thanks
Let us not be fearful
I have then to investigate
Betrayed into deplorable error
They were his grandparents
Men everywhere testify
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
For let it be observed first
I must leave any detailed development
A book that rends and tears like a broken saw
Yes, it was extraordinarily fine
It is an admirable way of putting it
And it is certainly true
What I shall actually attempt to show here
Lost in a delirious wonder
What can you possibly mean?
C
He couldn't think of anything to say
You know I'm not given to sentimentality
Aggravated to an unspeakable degree
Nor should any attempt be made
Like leaves in wintry weather
He is a poor dissembler   [dissemble = conceal behind a false appearance]
The disjointed babble of the chronicler
As elastic as a steel spring
Like an unwelcome thought
Do you think there is anything ominous in it?
And in thus speaking, I am not denying
I am not about to defend
Under all conceivable circumstances
Who has not felt the contrast
I know it is said
How does it happen
A spirit inimical to learning
As stated in our previous letter
I was not without some anxiety
I shall show that I am not
I was no more than a straw on the torrent of his will
Feeding his scholarly curiosity
How droll you are!
It doesn't sound plausible to me
His mind echoed with words
Let it not be objected
The stars pale and silent as a seer
Dull and trite commonplaces
with the air of an elderly clergyman knocked down by an omnibus
Like a great ring of pure and endless light
I have no sympathy with the men
The moon on the tower slept soft as snow
Our relations with your house must have hitherto been very pleasant
I hope none who hear me
like white doves going into the shadow of a wood
The stillness of the star-hung night
Announced in a tone of pious satisfaction
It has been a relief to talk to you
Those grades will not get you into college
The inexorable facts closed in on him
Black his hair as the wintry night
There is a more important question
Redolent of the night lamp
This is like saying
The enclosed list has all the details
I hope we may forget
Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill
It will interest you to know
The eyes burnt with an amazing fire
A piteous aspect of woe
It is permissible to gratify such an impulse
I tremble at the task
Bartering the higher aspirations of life
Visible and palpable pains and penalties
The voice was sharp and peremptory
Nor do I doubt
Rudely disconcerting in her behavior
And I will tell you why
You will clearly understand
Her interest flagged
I am really afraid I don't know
I have assumed throughout
Her voice was full of temper
And now behold a mystery
Sullen and widespread discontent
He poured bitter and biting ridicule on his discomfited opponents
Let thy mouth murmur like the doves
That was very thoughtful of you
The wild whirl of nameless regret and passionate sorrow
Like some poor nigh-related guest, that may not rudely be dismist
It is with pity unspeakable
Penetrate beneath the surface to the core
C
Possibly the enclosure may suggest to you
You will expect me to say something about
Then again, when men say
He began to laugh with that sibilant laugh
In a position of undisputed supremacy
It is not quite clear
Hopelessly belated in its appearance
I am not insensible
I will ask the indulgence
It is for us to ask
Full of presentiments of some evil
As if smitten by a sudden spasm, he jerked towards her
Swift summer into the autumn flowed
Let me speak frankly
The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk
Very good, I'll do so
I am exceedingly glad of this opportunity
Here again the testimony corroborates
The tears welled up and flowed abundantly
Imperiled in a restless age
Involuntary thrill of gratified vanity
One word in courtesy I must say
But it will be a misfortune
An inarticulate echo of his longing
And if you think it your duty
You have a genius for saying the right thing
I want to think with you
The eternal sea, which like a childless mother,
Like some unshriven churchyard thing, the friar crawled
He flushed bright crimson
of a Father watching His myriad children at play
Zealous in the cause he affected to serve
Over and over the paroxysms of grief and longing submerged her
like fawns at play
M
Let us briefly review
The suspicion of secret malevolence
In spite of our best efforts it is not probable
I hasten to concede
But if you wish to know
Restless as a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day
W
Fed by many currents from the long stream of human experience
Hidebound in official pedantry       [pedantry = attention to detail]
I think you will see
Streamed o'er his memory like a forest flame
Let us now apply the views presented
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
                                         [lineaments = distinctive shape]
The music of unforgotten years sounded again in his soul
We will be pleased to give it careful consideration
An ardent and gifted youth
I am still a little of an idealist
It may, perhaps, seem wonderful
The angry blood burned in his face
Truly it is a subject for astonishment
Fluid as thought
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
Tired with a dull listless fatigue
An unparalleled and almost miraculous growth
I am now going to attempt
I have yet a more cogent reason
I hope for our own sakes
A robust and consistent application
as the snow-covered heights receive from clouds
It is an intolerable idea
I prefer to reserve my judgment
And so through all phases
She wore an air of wistful questioning
Is there any language of reproach
I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it
Unspoiled by praise or blame
There is another sense in which
I do not fear a contradiction
I have another observation to add
Still I imagine you would consider it
Do you attach any particular meaning to that?
Like planets in the sky
Dissatisfaction had settled on his mind like a shadow
Like a distant star glimmering steadily in the darkness
Unjust and unrighteous persecution
We ask that you kindly let us hear from you
The secret and subduing charm of the woods
as clear as elemental diamond, or serene morning air
By no means inconsolable
Here I must pause for a moment
Luminous with great thoughts
He looked fagged and sallow, like the day   [fagged = worked to exhaustion]
Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom
I feel myself scarcely competent to judge
This absurdity arises
Dominated by no prevailing taste or fashion
Frankly, I don't see why it should
We are at a loss to understand why
Turning the world topsy-turvey
He flung diffidence to the winds
Emotions flashed across her face
Stared about like calves in a pen
The inaccessible solitude of the sky
The panorama of life was unrolled before him
Faint and distant as the light of a sun that has long set
I must for want of time omit
Fortunately I am not obliged
Like ghosts, from an enchanter fleeing
Will anyone answer
And we are brought to the same conclusion
A sudden gleam of insight
The situation is uncommonly delicate
I have been puzzling over a dilemma
Impatient as the wind
An example or two will illustrate
He drank of the spirit of adventure
The murmur of the surf boomed in melancholy mockery
I was piqued   [piqued = resentment; indignation]
You know that it is impossible to
I am rather disposed to think
Like clouds of gnats with perfect lineaments
Promptly on receipt of your telegram
fly about like white butterflies
Like a watch-worn and weary sentinel
Sinks clamorous like mill-waters at wild play
Like earth's decaying leaves
And in like manner
Experience and instinct warred within her
The telephone rang
CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES
It's not relevant to this discussion
White hands through her hair,
In his customary sententious fashion
But however that may be
The most concise tribute paid
Stimulated to an ever deepening subtlety
and the genius of her mind
I am always glad to do anything to please you
She yielded to a wave of pity
We may not know precisely how
The silence grew stolid
She walked like a galley-slave
Here arises the eternal question
Strangely it's true
As far as we know
A sudden revulsion
I am one of those who believe
It would collapse as if by enchantment
Indolently handsome eyes
I think we may safely conclude
Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play
The wind was in high frolic with the rain
The world wavers within its circle like a dream
I compliment you on your good sense
      [guttering = To melt through the side of the hollow in a candle
with its stars and dews and perfumes
I am apprehensive
It is sheer madness
Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king
Love that sings and has wings as a bird
A happy and compensating experience
August and imperial names in the kingdom of thought
I use the word in the sense
Inspired by a vague malevolence
You leave no alternative
This is what I am led to say
Vigorous and well compacted
The room had caught a solemn and awful quietude
Cities scattered over the world like ant-hills
Like notes which die when born, but still haunt the echoes of the hill
The capacity for refined pursuits
She enjoyed a delicious throng of sensations
The very silence of the place appeared a source of peril
I think you will pardon my saying
The deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude
And then hastily to conclude
We believe with a sincere belief
Sunk in a phraseological quagmire
We are willing to travel
Soliciting a continuance of your patronage
Like a ship tossed to and fro on the waves of life's sea
I may add, speaking for my own part
Thoughts came thronging in panic haste
Why not go now and save the waiting
You will pardon me, I am sure
We must, therefore, insist on the terms of the agreement
But this is no place for controversy
Surely it is a paradox
I have seen for myself
A shimmer of golden sun shaking through the trees
In the same manner I rely
Ransack the vocabulary
like bluest water seen through mists of rain
She frowned incomprehension
Assuredly it is this
I have no particular inclination
Let us enumerate
Quiet as a nun's face
Now, I understand the argument
It is a perversion of terms
I beg emphatically to say
White as the moon's white flame
Small as a grain of mustard seed
SECTION XI
A book to beguile the tedious hours
Yet may I not remind you
The blemishes of an extraordinary reputation
You see things rose-colored
It is a peculiar pleasure to me
like windless clouds o'er a tender sky
Beset with smiling hills
It is a common error
I can not hope adequately to respond
And yet one more quotation
The dimness of the sealed eye and soul
Her heart fluttered with a vague terror
He had acted exactly like an automaton
A deep and strange suggestiveness
Lost in indolent content
We are indeed sorry to learn
In the flush and heyday of youth and gaiety and loveliness
The bluntness of a provincial
I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views
He was in an optimistic after-dinner mood
One important topic remains
A painful thought was flooding his mind
It assumes the shape of malignity
A dogmatic and self-righteous spirit
It seems to me a striking circumstance
Borne from lip to lip
I am glad to express the belief
F
Before was the open malignant sea
Shadowy faces, known in dreams, pass as petals upon a stream
White clouds like daisies
Blended with courage and devotion
Home was far and hope was dim
His soul was compressed into a single agony of prayer
Style comes, if at all, like the bloom upon fruit,
It could not be otherwise
Before I proceed to compare
These alone would not be sufficient
As pale as any ghost
It is your privilege to think so
I really do not know
A glance of extraordinary meaning told him everything
I am not prepared to say
That is final and conclusive
Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words
I do not vouch for
The hint of tranquillity and self-poise
It was loud and vulgar
A thing of moods and moments
Let anyone imagine to himself
Beyond the farthest edge of night
It staggered the eye, like the sight of water running up hill
Like winds that bear sweet music,
I am overjoyed to hear you say so
I might venture to claim
A proposition inherently vicious
What could be more true
My muscles are as steel
Please consider this letter an acknowledgment
           [obdurate = Hardened in wrongdoing; stubbornly impenitent]
Morbid and subjective brooding
Thus it comes to pass
I shall speak with becoming frankness
I am here by the favor of your invitation
The bus was late
I could never forgive myself for that
If we survey
It is very splendid of you
And where, let me ask
I have been extremely anxious
a white moon drifts before a shimmering sky
Tense with the anguish of spiritual struggle
His gaze searched her face
That is a pure assumption
I think it probable
I am suppressing many of the details
I assure myself
When one remembers
The breast-plate of righteousness
As dry as desert dust
Transformed with an overmastering passion
It is still more surprising
We are confident that you will have no further trouble
The hubbub and turmoil of the great world
The see-saw of a wavering courage
Under separate cover we are mailing to you
I feel that it is not true
Refreshed like dusty grass after a shower
The rule will always hold good
But who has not seen
It is my belief
You speak with authority
I am sure you feel the truth
Let everyone consider
An indescribably touching incident
I will only take an occasion to express
Now, with regard to
A high pitch of eloquence
If we can help you in any way
But on the other hand
I remain, my dear sir, yours faithfully
The question is deeply involved
Another thought importuned him
Like a great tune to which the planets roll
She brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together
She felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions
It's so amusing, isn't it
It would be a misfortune
A commendable restraint
Whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes
The more you examine this matter
Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened
The holiday by the seaside was one of our best
A supercilious scorn and pity          [supercilious =  haughty disdain]
Sadness prevailed among her moods
That theory isn't tenable
She was gripped with a sense of suffocation and panic
                      [inveigh = angry disapproval; protest vehemently]
The outpourings of a tenderness reawakened by remorse
Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea
It makes life insupportable
The loud and urgent pageantry of the day
Imperious in its demands            [imperious = arrogantly domineering]
I shrink from the contemplation
The agreement seems to be ideal
What more shall I say
We venture to enclose herewith
Forever echo in the heart
We are in a position to give you considerable help
She adjusted the volume on her music player
Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise
It was cold, hard, and frosty
In a transport of ambitious vanity
Like crystals of snow
I verily believe
But I wander from my point
The constant iteration of the sea's wail
One almost wishes
He was giving his youth away by handfuls
I think I have rightly spoken
Now, is there any ground or basis for
There must be extenuating circumstances
I have already alluded to
                                   [horologist = one who repairs watches]
It is scarcely necessary to insist
Like echoes from an antenatal dream
We think you will agree that the other house is nicer
His troubled spirit shifted its load
His eyes glowed like blue coals
The lights winked
No mark of trick or artifice
Your judgments are very sound
Passive and tractable as a child
I feel tempted to introduce here
One bleared star, faint glimmering like a bee
I believe from my own personal experience
With all my heart I share
There was a stinging sensation of pain and suspense
but still invested with the dignity of immortality
She forced a faint quivering smile
One of the foreseen and inevitable results
Nor can I forget either
So when I hear people say
It is a matter of absorbing interest
The meticulous preciosity of the lawyer and the logician
Let me also say a word in regard
You will understand my anxiety
Yet I would have to think
I admit, of course, at once
Common ground of agreement
It is not an unknown occurrence
Dependency had dropped from her like a cast-off cloak
A more plausible objection is found
The roar of the traffic rose to thunder
His talk is like an incessant play of fireworks
It was always a chore to mow the lawn
Untameable as flies
His soul was wrung with a sudden wild homesickness
As far as my limits allow
Her mood was unaccountably chilled
He was nothing if not grandiloquent
It is one of the burning questions of the day
Awaiting your pleasure
I speak within the hearing of
The scullion with face shining like his pans
They were surely beyond the farthest edge of night
Like sweet thoughts in a dream
I cannot precisely determine
I pass on from that
loosed out of the brooding hills, it came to pass
His intense love of excitement and adventure was his downfall
Prison is not the answer
like pensive moon-worshipers in an ecstasy of prayerless bloom
Where heroes die as leaves fall
leaped down their rocky stairways like wild steeds
Reflect upon the possible consequences
He sweeps the field of battle like a monsoon
Perhaps not in the strictest sense
But in my opinion there is no need
If anyone could conceive
Does it not shock you to think
The lambs raced around, enjoying life
with little momentary shiverings and shadows
One lesson history may be said to repeat
These instances are far from common
A most repulsive and incomprehensible idiom
Solitary and sorely smitten souls
Lash themselves into fury
Her heart was full of speechless sorrow
We will take a taxi to the airport
The subject which has been assigned to me
It is a most pertinent question
It still remains to be observed
To take a very different instance
Of course I do not maintain
I have another objection
I believe I understand perfectly just how you feel about
I take a broader and bolder position
Accidental rather than intentional
We realize that this is simply an oversight on your part
Accidents which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention
I have laid much stress upon
Is it not obvious
You are greatly to be envied
That is a fair question, perhaps
I have anticipated the objection
Like the shudder of a doomed soul
I have been given to understand
Your usual attention will oblige
I begin by observing
Nay, there is a general feeling
In a spirit of friendliness and conciliation
It is but too true
Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o'er his head
A sheaf of letters
Fertility of argumentative resource
Wordsworth, thy music like a river rolls
Again, very numerous are the cases
The exertion of an inherent power
We take the liberty of writing to you.
E
Indulge in pleasing discursiveness
It's a fantastic opportunity
How can I thank you?
An oppressive sense of strange sweet odor
An afternoon of painfully constrained behavior
Her heart pounded in her throat
The inmost recesses of the human heart
The handmaid of tyranny
Yet I feel quite free to say
Like a mist the music drifted from the silvery strings
STRIKING SIMILES
Foolish and inflexible superstition
Her hair hung down like summer twilight
I shall here use the word to denote
She loved the sensation of golden sweetness and delight
A haughty self-assertion of equality
A campfire is warming and sociable
Blithe as a bird               [blithe = carefree and lighthearted]
We are all familiar with
Acquired sentiments of propriety
For myself, certainly I think
Like a locomotive-engine with unsound lungs
There is a multitude of facts
Despondency clung to him like a garment that is wet
I am incredulous
In requital for various acts of rudeness
Pure as the snowy leaves that fold over the flower's heart
I don't know when I have heard anything so lamentable
I trust it is not presumptuous
Rage, rage ye tears, that never more should creep
I am not concerned to argue
We must impress upon you the need to be early
I have before me the statistics
As close as oak and ivy stand
I have seen the ravens flying, like banners of old wars
I highly appreciate this mark of confidence
I wish to express my profound gratification
Scorned as an impracticable theory
We have the honor to inform you that you have won first prize
A glassy expression of inattention
You have but to observe
Abundant and congenial employment
I venture to say
A shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration
This much is certain
Here is a complete answer to
But it would be vain to attempt
It has been stigmatized as irrelevant
All this being considered
As directed in your letter, we are shipping to you
The perils that beset us here
Then you merely want to ask my advice?
Q
Let all of us labor in this work
Advance by leaps and bounds
Well, this is good fortune
As great as the first day of creation
Upon being advised that these terms are satisfactory
There were hills in the distance
The simple truth is
I would urge upon you
Stood like a wave-beaten rock
It would be well for us to reflect
The deep flush ebbed out of his face
Bright as a fallen fragment of the sky
My mind is like a sieve
I give my word gladly
She nodded slowly
She could summon tears as one summons servants
Impatient and authoritative tones
We hear it is said sometimes
Each moment was an iridescent bubble fresh-blown from the lips of fancy
I will accept the general proposition
Like bells that waste the moments with their loudness
Ineffably dreary and unpicturesque
Now, there is a close alliance between
Take vengeance upon arrogant self-assertion
In all ages of the world
Fixed convictions of mankind
Like the dew on the mountain
A purpose as the steady flame
We are not able to prove
My friends, I propose
I think we may ask in reply
I always will assert the right to
The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake
The impalpable presence of the new century
I observe, then, in the first place
Let's play games
She assented in precisely the right terms
Unmoving as a tombstone
Her voice sounded like that of a child
Devoid of hysteria and extravagance
Her stare dissolved
The quick pulse of gain
I detest exaggeration
Let us rather listen to
It's absolute folly
I well remember an occasion
I dwell with pleasure on the considerations
You can not assert
It is evidently supposed by many people
There is food for reflection in that
Little wonder therefore
Like the swell of Summer's ocean
I will co-operate with you
Like a knight worn out by conflict
I think extremely well of it
In conclusion, may I repeat
Never have I felt so forcibly
The still voice of the poet
These thoughts pierced me like thorns
This is a very serious situation
Mingled distrust and fear
She bandies adjectives with the best
Butterflies like gems
There were occasional flashes of tenderness and love
I am grateful to you for this honor
He found the silence intolerable
Lithe as a panther
It used to be a reproach
Fallen into the convenient oblivion of the waste-basket
I am sure you will not be surprised
Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility
Fortunately for us
Let us likewise remember
Like the bellowing of bulls
Her lips hardened
The windmill kept turning
To this I answer
The wonderful pageant of consciousness
I shall ask you to look very closely
Red tape of officialdom
The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria
Remorselessly swept into oblivion
He murmured a vague acceptance
The broad principle which I would lay down
Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream
Strangled by a snare of words
As you probably have been told
It's really very perplexing
I am in favor of
I do not depreciate for a moment
When will men understand
Conducive to well-being and efficiency
The teddy bear had black beady eyes
To the conclusion thus drawn
Dreams and visions were surpassed
He suppressed every sign of surprise
But it is necessary to explain
Ardently and enthusiastically convinced
His accent was so strong
The piquancy of the pageant of life     [piquancy = tart spiciness]
I am not capable of unraveling it
He surrendered himself to gloomy thought
The thought with which I shall close
Often enough life tosses like a fretful stream among rocky boulders
It is sometimes hard to determine
I deny the inference
This is according to our discussion
I regret this the less
Surely we can speak frankly
The billows burst like cannon down the coast
Here I ought to stop
We hope to hear favorably from you
Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud
I have thought it well to suggest
I find no better example than
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare
Waylay Destiny and bid him stand and deliver
We are at a loss to understand why you dressed like that
Whirled into rapid and ceaseless motion
One might be challenged to produce
Quaking and quivering like a short-haired puppy after a ducking
Essentially one-sided and incomplete
Dainty as flowers
An impenetrable screen of foliage
The intercepted glances of wondering eyes
I venture to propose another plan
You have asked me a riddle
We shall be pleased to take the matter up further
The sacred voice of inspiration
I pay tribute to
I recollect it clearly
I must qualify the statement
I must confess that I became rather alarmed
like a shipload of monkeys in a storm
Just mail the enclosed card
My thoughts ran leaping through the green ways of my mind
Nor does it matter much
Assumed almost heroic proportions
Disappearing into distance like a hazy sea
There are certain old truths
Happily there are exceptions to every rule
        [trenchant = forceful, effective, vigorous; incisive; distinct]
Gazed like a star into the morning light
In something of a parallel way
As supple as a step-ladder
A smile of exquisite urbanity
A distorted and pessimistic view of life
The dreams of poets come like music heard at evening
An unpatriotic and ignoble act
Her long black hair danced round her like a snake
Of course I am putting an impossible case
Never was there a greater mistake
I next come to the implicit assumption
In view of all these facts, we feel justified in claiming
There have been differences of opinion
I am not at liberty to discuss
As easily as the sun shines
As I understand this matter
The star-strewn spaces of the night
Let us, then, be assured
His mind murmurs like a harp among the trees
Your mind enthroned in the seventh circle of content
An ill-assorted vocabulary
I hope you will not think me irreverent
His voice was thick with resentment
But here let me say
like first-aid surgeons on the battlefield
Vivacity is her greatest charm
You will bear me out when I say
Yes, I dare say
Let me hope that I have said enough
His mood was one of pure exaltation
Let us consider for a moment
We are at your service at all times
He fell down on my threshold like a wounded stag
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream
It's your turn to wash the dishes
I do not despair of surmounting
Let us look briefly at a few particulars
He radiated vigor and abundance like a happy child
The glimmer of tall flowers standing
It must have been rather embarrassing
I must refrain from any comment
Thoughts vague as the fitful breeze
Like ships that have gone down at sea
An isle of Paradise, fair as a gem
I thought it most amusing
Shadowy vistas of sylvan beauty
I think you have great appreciation of values
It extorted from him expressions of irritability
I have thought it right on this day
An agreeable image of serene dignity
You have misunderstood everything
The hollowest of hollow shams
New dreams began to take wing in his imagination
Inordinate greed and love of wealth
Now every nerve in my body seemed like a strained harp-string
Every curve of her features seemed to express
He gave her a baffled stare
An almost pathetic appearance of ephemeral fragility
Strict and unalloyed veracity
The popular notion is
Let us try to form a mental picture
The precarious tenure of fame
Before was the open malignant sea
A breath of melancholy made itself felt
The simplest thing in the world
Nothing could be more striking
Great shuddering seized on her
like a snake across his perfect name
Shake like an aspen leaf
She fell into a dreamy silence
My present business is
We desire to express our appreciation of your patronage
The question was disconcertingly frank
Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth
I hold to the principle
I thank you for the appreciative tone
Still it may with justice be said
Earth danced under a heat haze
Skies as clear as babies' eyes
It is in vain
Bidden by your invitation to a discussion
As a lion grieves at the loss of her whelps
As busy as a bee
I am sensible of the flattery
Concentrated and implacable resolve
The view is more misleading
These are my reasons for
And so I am reminded of a story
Easy-going to the point of lethargy
I tender my thanks to you
I leave history to judge
Don't try this at home
Peaceful as a village cricket-green on Sunday
It is an ingenious theory
I think we may say, therefore
by an air of indolence and languor         [languor = dreamy, lazy mood]
An extensive and populous country
H
Oh, yes, I quite admit that
If anyone is so dim of vision
I did it as a personal favor
It is in every way appropriate
I am indebted for the honor
It is no significant thing
We have the honor to be, gentlemen
I am glad of this public opportunity
The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly
upon the cool and still piazza
The tone of it was certainly hostile
Her interest flagged
Her holy love that like a vestal flame had burned
He gave his ear to this demon of false glory
He flung caution to the wind
The scene all comes back
Smoking is not permitted here
As a matter of fact
It is a great pleasure to meet you
The ingenuities of legal verbiage
As belated as they are fallacious
When cards, invitations, and three-corn'd notes
Come, where's your sense of humor?
He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed
We trust you will find it correct
I shall best attain my object
It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it
W
Those who have watched the tendencies
You drive me around the bend
I am going to spare you and myself
It seems like a distracting dream
A protest wavered on her lip
I will state with perfect distinctness
There was something so kindly in its easy candor
Turning easily and securely as on a perfect axle
It is at once inconsistent
For your convenience I enclose a stamped envelope
Unheralded, like some tornado
The constant pressure of anxieties
Love hovered in her gaze
Exquisite lucidity of statement
I wish rather to call your attention
If I recollect aright
It was a night of stupefying surprises
In a flash of revelation
I need only to observe
And so on
It's not a matter of vast importance
A rage akin to frenzy
Never did there devolve
Better to be red than dead
I am sure that I echo the sentiment
We shall be happy to meet your requirements
Q
Most dangerous!
Exasperating to the last degree
A bicycle has two wheels
If there be one lesson more than another
I am not proposing to set forth
Unexpected obstacles and inextricable difficulties
Taking the facts by themselves
The rosy-hued sky went widening off into the distance
The swelling tide of memory
But I may be permitted to speak
My skin is as sallow as gold
It is historically true
As diamond cuts diamond
But seriously speaking, what is the use of it?
A tumult of vehement feeling
In this rapid and slight enumeration
It has seldom been surpassed
Not at all
Obstacles that are difficult but not insuperable
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
And now I have said enough to explain
Those things are not forgotten at once
His eyes literally blazed with savage fire
I have always been under the impression
Shall we have a compact?
A perfect carnival of fun
It was a laugh of jovial significance
Resist a common adversary
like a turkey when it spreads its feathers
I do not forget the practical necessity
Like the setting of a tropical sun
He spoke in impassioned and earnest language
In the realm of conjecture
The buzz of idolizing admiration
Like a slim bronze statue of Despair
B
Sharp restrictions of duty and opportunity
A few words will suffice to answer
So men are asking
There is nothing I should like so much
It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy
What can I say better
This is so peculiar
I will yield the whole question
The excitement of rival issues
In meeting this difficulty, I will not urge
I am glad you can see it in that way
But consider for a moment
Assuring you of every courtesy
The story seems to me incredible
The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven
I think it is quite right
I am assured and fully believe
It is not necessarily true
One of the golden twilights which transfigure the world
The magician could work miracles
I ask you if it is possible
Humiliating paltriness of revenge
I wouldn't put it just that way
What can be more intelligible
Inconceivable clumsiness of organization
A tumultuous rush of sensations
It may be conjectured
So at least it seems to me
Let that question be answered by
A quick shiver ruffled the brooding stillness of the water
Startled into perilous activity
This being understood, I ask
Absolutely vulgarized by too perpetual a parroting
There is a class of person
I would enter a protest
Ominous and swift days
Let us begin at the beginning
I want to thank you for your reply
What sorry and pitiful quibbling
In our estimate of the past
A relish for the sublime
The hints of an imaginable alliance
By no means
An intense travail of mind
Sway like blown moths against the rosewhite flame
Her two white hands like swans on a frozen lake
My breath to Heaven like vapor goes
Stung by his thoughts, and impatient of rest
An intolerable deal of guesswork
We may contemplate with satisfaction
                                         [exigencies = urgent situations]
But can this question
that he has piled on the seashore
But it is not fair to assert
I think there is no call on me to listen
A vastly extended vision of opportunity
I am not a person of prejudices
I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject
I will not quarrel with
Into the very vestibule of death we marched
It may not be uninteresting to any of you
The sadness in him deepened inexplicably
like a piquant and agreeable odor
The flattest and most obvious truisms
His face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine
No doubt there are many questions
Vicissitudes of wind and weather
Sentimental wailings for the past
Dwindled to alarmingly small dimensions
We have received no reply from you
And of this I am perfectly certain
It is indeed true
And it happens
We all agree as to
I take the liberty of observing
Cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire
Fresh and unsuspected loveliness
That was exceedingly generous
Surely this is simple enough
Oddly disappointing and fickle
When we get so far as this
It will doubtless be more convenient for you
I pass then to our second division
It was in the full understanding
I set out with saying
I can with propriety speak here
Abundant reason is there
It is more than probable
Brisk as a wasp in the sunshine
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new-born age
She disarmed anger and softened asperity        [asperity = harshness]
It is not too much to say
As a matter of convenience and economy
He evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl
Blustering desire for publicity
You know I'm in an agony of curiosity
What would you say
A temporary expedient
I see your point of view
It is an unforgivable offense
The imminent fatality awaiting him
By virtue of his impassioned curiosity
Looking like a snarling beast baulked of its prey
Have you ever noticed
The answer is easy to find
We are pleased to send you descriptive circulars
Like cobwebs woven round the limbs of an infant giant
If one seeks to measure
A needlessly offensive manner
As a proof of this
At the utmost we can say
How human language staggers when
I really thought that you would excuse me
I must remind my hearers of
It will be seen at a glance
Does it not seem something like idiocy to
May I be privileged to hear it?
I feel respect and admiration
If I am wrong
We must remember
I don't insist on your believing me
Is not that the common sentiment
Air like wine
Upcast like foam of the effacing tide
All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him
These instances are indications
The corn was by now golden
I was constantly watchful to
The policeman did not belive him
A pang of jealousy was mingled with scorn
I have been requested to say a word
A novel and perplexing course
His dignity counseled him to be silent
That is hardly consistent
Partial and fragmentary evidence
A sudden uncontrollable outburst of feeling
Again, I ask the gentleman
The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up
They fly like spray
Her eyes danced with malice
She challenged his dissent
Time drops in decay, like a candle burnt out
I have never heard it put so well
As sudden as a dislocated joint slipping back into place
This from the nature of the case
I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously
I
Bewildering multiplication of details
Her smile was faintly ridiculous
I have said what I solemnly believe
So much on this subject
Pure as the azure above them
But we are to recollect
Soaring as swift as smoke from a volcano springs
Chastened and refined by experience
We are pleased to receive your request for information
W
Divested of all personal feelings
Well, gentlemen, it must be confessed
like a pair of turtle-doves that could not live asunder day or night
I quite endorse what has been said
All the place is peopled with sweet airs
Deep dark well of sorrow
But is it quite possible to hold
Next, from what has been said it is plain
I make no reflection whatever
Under the willow-tree glimmered her face
Reluctant to appear in so equivocal a character
Men are in the habit of saying
MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES
The book has two hundred pages
I don't know quite why you should say that
There is an ancient story to the effect
Contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment
Singing and dancing is for fun times only
It makes it all quite interesting
Involved in profound uncertainty
She spoke with a triumphant voice
And then when it is said
An exalted and chimerical sense of honor
Something resistant and inert, like the obstinate rolling over
On this auspicious occasion
Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric
Soft as the south-wind
Erroneous assumptions and sophistries
Draw back in distrust and misgiving
Soft as the landscape of a dream
Babbling like a child
We had a great conversation
                                  [preciosity = extreme overrefinement]
And I might say this
Impelled by strong conviction
A sweet voice caroling like a gold-caged nightingale
You cannot regret it more than I do
In order to appreciate the force of
Diverting her eyes, she pondered
By the way, I have not mentioned
Dance like a wave of the sea
A glassy expression of inattention gave away his feelings
Conceded from a sense of justice
His torpid ideas awoke again
With reference to your favor of yesterday
A slow thought that crept like a cold worm through all his brain
Peopled the night with thoughts
C
I could almost allege it as a supreme example
I confine myself to saying
We are at your service at all times
As easy as a turn of the hand
I am obliged to go still further
Ten pleasures are better than ten irritations
A tangle of ugly words
Like oceans of liquid silver
The inference is inescapable
Of course I am aware
You need to explain this to us
Thus I am led on to another remark
Like roses that in deserts bloom and die
I remember an intimation
The occasion that calls us together
The sound of the sea waxed
The stillness of a forced composure
What do we understand to have been
I am not an alarmist
Haunted with a chill and unearthly foreboding
The roller coaster almost left the rails
And yet this notion is, I conceive
A voice soft and sweet as a tune that one knows
Like thoughts whose very sweetness
Oh, I appreciate that in you!
Beset by agreeable hallucinations
Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer
Why, again, should I take notice
A soul as white as heaven
Well-concerted and well-timed stratagems
An air of affected civility
Let's have some new ideas here
A process of searching and shifting took place
A detached segment of life
S
I do not merely urge
I will venture to express the hope
Her eyes were as a dove that sickeneth
There is no justification for
Nursed by brooding thought
I shall not weary your patience
I
I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness
I have no hesitation in asserting
The beach sand was warm underfoot
There was a gush of entrancing melody
She ascended the throne
Like a knot of daisies lay the hamlets on the hill
Why not allow us this opportunity to satisfy you
Giving an ear to a little neighborly gossip
A profusion of compliments
I am not going into sordid details
But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?
He is anything but obtuse
The consequence of an agitated mind
Intangible and indescribable essence
L
An irrelevant bit of magniloquence
A voice as low as the sea
He condescended to intimate speech with her
How long will it take to get there
Kind of unscrupulous contempt for gravity
So it comes to pass
His impatient scorn exploded
As a sea disturbed by opposing winds
Indeed, but it is quite possible
Like the Spring-time, fresh and green
I must fairly tell you
I shall certainly admit
As your experience has probably shown you
Like the sap that turns to nectar, in the velvet of the peach
I have little hope that I can add anything
As arbitrary as a cyclone and as killing as a pestilence
This is indeed good fortune
Sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine spent from the plowing
Pierced to the quick
And it is undeniable, I say
Ill-dissimulated fits of ambition
Let us inquire also
Seething with suppressed wrath
I think it is not too much to say
They affected the tone of an impartial observer
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain made its mark
A swiftly unrolling panorama of dreams
I distrust all general theories of
His mood yielded
Let me once more urge upon you
Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds
She curled her lip with defiant scorn
Childishly inaccurate and absurd
A first faint trace of irritation
It would be invidious for me   [invidious = rousing ill will, animosity]
We are extremely desirous of pleasing our patrons
Here I am considering
Thanking you for your past patronage
My body is too frail
The causes for the delay were beyond our control
Every lineament was clear as in the sculptor's thought
Exquisite graciousness of manner
Amid distress and humiliation
We have found it impossible
U
It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company
I think its tone is remarkably temperate
Summer will soon end
Links in the chain of reasoning
                                [vituperation = harshly abusive language]
It is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity
I happen to differ
As one who has climbed above the earth's eternal snowline
Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought
In a state of virtuous complacency
A ghastly mixture of defiance and conceit
Unfathomed depths and impossibilities
I'm glad you could make it
like the flight of a million arrows
I am glad you feel so deeply about it
The sharp and vehement assertion of authority
It would be unfair to praise
Retort leaped to his lips
While we feel that we are in no way responsible
As the light straw flies in dark'ning whirlwinds
Her strength was scattered in fits of agitation
In the first place, therefore, I consider
There was no glint of hope anywhere
I am luckily disengaged to-day
Let me protest against the manner
It would be an inexcusable omission
I mean by this
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
I do not find it an unpleasant subject
The zenith turned shell pink
I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist
How amiable you are to say so
Fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive
The time machine made startling leaps over vast gulfs of time
Have you any rooted objection to it?
Like one who talks of what he loves in dream
I am sure this generous audience will pardon me
If you would see the most conclusive proof
I find myself in the position of
Rehabilitated and restored to dignity
Fragile as a spider's web
And again, it is said
Yet I, for one, do not hesitate to admit
Absorbed in a stream of thoughts and reminiscences
Awaiting his summons to the eternal silence
A fastidious sense of fitness
Barricade the road to truth
Armed all over with subtle antagonisms
After this it remains only to say
In language terse yet familiar
I have no thought of venturing to say
But sooner or later
I do not think that I need further discuss
A faint smile lightened her brooding face
Like a vision of the morning air
It is easy enough to add
But this much I affirm as true
I can not charge myself with
The ebb and flow of events
Diffusing beneficent results
I submit that in such a case
Fierce as the flames
I find this agreeable mental exhilaration
I shall never forget your kindness
I sincerely hope that you will give the subject your earnest consideration
Thus much I may be allowed to say
I wish I could explain my point more fully
We will at once enter your order
It was the last year of my childhood
The dead and dusty past
Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished
like some dripping cavern
As quick as the movement of some wild animal
We expect to be in the market soon
At the outset of this inquiry
Naked vigor of resolution
The wine flows like blood
A thousand hopes for your success
An insatiable appetite for trifles
A step was at her heels
Until sleep overtakes us at a stride
Skirmishes and retreats of conscience
And to this conclusion you must come
The gift of prophecy
I do not know whether you are aware of it
Stern determination to inflict summary justice
I can most truthfully assure you
D
Their glances met like crossed swords
The wind charged furiously through it, panting towards the downs
A tragic futility
Against all this concurring testimony
An ample and imposing structure
Let us bear perpetually in mind
What a charming place you have here
He only smiled with fatuous superiority
She sat eyeing him with frosty calm
Stripped to its bare skeleton
In a strain of exaggerated gallantry
Under these circumstances we are willing to extend the terms
You have all read the story
She looked like the picture of a young rapt saint, lost in heavenly musing
It was hard, sharp, and glittering as a sword
I am inclined to agree with you
My body is too frail for its moods
A sense of indescribable reverence
There was spendthrift grandeur
You did it excellently
I wish to be perfectly fair
Necessity thus imposed by prudence
Moments of utter idleness and insipidity
All that's beautiful drifts away like the waters
Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail
Descanting on them cursorily      [descanting = discussion or discourse]
Such considerations as these
Is there any evidence here
I speak with feeling upon this point
Like a stone thrown at random
Fills life up like a cup with bubbling and sparkling liquor
A glassy stare of deprecating horror
What, then, was the nature of
Insolent and riotous excess
I will venture a single remark
A mysterious and inscrutable power
Examples of terrific and explosive energy
The most exacting and exciting business
Slender and thin as a slender wire
Sweet as music she spoke
A frigid touch of the hand chilled his skin
I fearlessly appeal
And her cheek was like a rose
Be confident, therefore
In its most odious and intolerable shape
Unexceptional in point of breeding
In addition to these arguments
Are you still obdurate?
A dark and relentless fate
We all feel the force of the maxim
Like the fitting of an old glove to a hand
I am not as unreasonable as you suppose
Impartial and exacting judgment
U
I repeat, I am not speaking
Or to come nearer home
But it is not necessary to suppose
It was so humiliating
The vain wish has sometimes been indulged
Attained by rigorous self-restraint
A
You are at a parting of the ways
S
He was quaking on the precipice of a bad bilious attack
Do it as soon as possible
I think something may be said in favor of
She will be my bride
The streams laughed to themselves
Anger simmered within him
The years stretched before her like some vast blank page
A condescending and patronizing spirit
I prefer a practical view
It is scarcely questioned
I have not the right to reproach
Yet I suppose it is worth while
The fact has often been insisted
Banish such thoughts
Her beauty broke on him like some rare flower
Pale as a drifting blossom
Strong bricks are important to a solid building
I have no delusions on that score
His face was torn with conflict
Now, I am justified in calling this
K
I do not comprehend your meaning
The vision fled him
It is exceedingly unfortunate
I predict that you will
The testimony of history is
Power to assuage the thirst of the soul
One very striking tendency
Delicacy of perception and quick tact
The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel
By way of rejoinder
This is the sentiment of mankind
I have demonstrated to you
Moreover, when we pass judgment
He went hot and cold
Wrapped in a sudden intensity of reflection
I rise with some trepidation
How very interesting
All the sky was mother-of-pearl and tender
His fortune melted away like snow in a thaw
I have no acquaintance with
I do again and again urge upon you
Pleasant and flower-strewn vistas of airy fancy
He turned on me like a thunder-cloud
In the fullest sense
I speak with some degree of encouragement
We hesitated for a while to pursue the matter
Eternally fruitful and stimulating
A pristine vigor of style
The precursor of violence
C
I want to know the character
T
That tree is in flower
Weigh the merits and demerits
Unconquerable fidelity to duty
But we ask, perhaps
But none the less peremptorily
Welcomed at first with skeptical contempt
Well, I call it scandalous
There was a hint of death in the icy breath of the gale
In reply to your valued favor
Unfailing and miraculous foresight
It will not do for a man to say
Like phantoms gathered by the sick imagination
The mazes of conflicting testimony
Will you permit me to thank you
I
Admirable mastery of technique
Now, if you will clearly understand
Don't go there tonight
A temper which brooked no resistance
In a frowning abstraction
I am very glad to have the honor
Her breath is like a cloud
The evening comes with slow steps
I consider I have said enough in proof
A multitude of groundless alarms
That is rather awkward
Let it be clearly understood, I repeat it
A pleasant flow of appropriate language
Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
A secret and wistful charm
Seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes
In a manner that sometimes terrifies me
It is not logical to say
We can not but be struck with
His whole soul wavered and shook like a wind-swept leaf
I weigh more than she does
Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees
I do not think this at all an exaggeration
You know the legend which has grown up
I lately heard it affirmed
A most unseasonable piece of impertinence
Rarely brought to pass
Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart
But let us look a little further
I am very happy to be here
Minutely and rationally exposing their imperfections
It is not ours to pronounce
And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted
This is conceded by
I had in common with others
It is made evident
It is obvious
I do not pretend to argue
It is immaterial whether
Revealed his doings like those of bees in a glass hive
Ideas which spread with the speed of light
Here I only insist upon
I yielded to the earnest solicitations
The intrusive question faded
Espoused with extraordinary ardor
It now becomes my pride and privilege
The witch laughed gleefully
Often employed promiscuously
I must apologize for intruding upon you
I am deeply insensible of the compliment
We are out of stock
The delimitation is sufficiently definite
We are not disinterested
The circumstances under which we meet
His heart rebuked him
Adventitious aids to memory
Like a sheeted ghost
Do not overlook this opportunity
Inveterate forces of opposition
But we want something more for explanation
I do not understand how it can apply
It is no doubt true
It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant
A modicum of truth
Like stepping out on summer evenings from the glaring ball-room
It is worth while to notice
I will not argue this
His constraint was excruciating
The most amazing impudence
Awaiting your further commands
Set down with meticulous care
Enforced by coercive measures
Rent by internal contentions
I can not better illustrate this argument
After examination we can confidently say
This, at least, is sure
I regret that I am not able to remember
The early morning of the Indian summer day was tinged with blue mistiness
It appears to me, on the contrary
Let this be the record made
I am deeply imbued with the conviction
And a tear like silver, glistened in the corner of her eye
But, further, I shall now demonstrate
We are impervious to certain rules
It is no wonder
We must not mistake
I am under a very great obligation
To make my story quite complete
A curious vexation fretted her
We are approaching an era
The clouds that move like spirits o'er the welkin clear   [welkin = sky]
That which flutters the brain for a moment
Their indignation waxed fast and furious
Nothing could be more captious or unfair
                      [verdure = lush greenness of flourishing vegetation]
I appeal in the first place
At once epigrammatic and arresting      [epigrammatic = terse and witty]
The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below
A fund of curious information
You will find interest, we believe, in this advance announcement
I wish at the outset
Keen power of calculation and unhesitating audacity
It may sound strange to you
With regard to your inquiry
He had the gift of deep, dark silences
Let us labor and pray
A painful thought was flooding his mind
I simply lay my finger on a fact
I have not the means of forming a judgment
I see as clearly as any man possibly can
A strange compound of contradictory elements
I have been pointing out how
Her voice, with a tentative question in it, rested in air
A great sickness of heart overcame him
yielded proof that they were born for immortality
But it is not possible to believe
But some other things are to be noted
Slavish doctrines of sectarianism
Away he rushed like a cyclone
The roses were in bloom
And did a man try to persuade me
I fear that's too technical for me
Night after night the skies were blue and bubbling with stars
                               [sententious = terse and energetic; pithy]
You will join with me, I trust
I have the honor to propose
I look in vain
I have no doubt whatever
They were all beaming with pleasurable anticipation
A curious and inexplicable uneasiness
White sails of sloops like specters
She had a charming air of vigor and vitality
A constant source of surprise and delight
Yet it is perfectly plain
As a leaf that beats on a mountain
Exposed to damaging criticism
As reticent as a well-bred stockbroker
The beauty of her quiet life was like a rose in blowing
They had hands like claws
If we have not made everything perfectly clear, please let us know
I have not allowed myself
If we are to reason on the fact
Naturally prone to believe
In these sentiments I agree
Mockery crept into her tone
I should appreciate your confidence greatly
Your thoughts are buzzing like a swarm of bees
The place was like some enchanted town of palaces
I am willing to know
A calmness settled on his spirit
Refreshing as descending rains to sunburnt climes
You know the familiar axiom
A bitterness crept into her face
A mood of hard skepticism
I don't justify my presumption
If I may be allowed modestly to suggest
We can only applaud the sentiment
The nameless and inexpressible fascination of midnight music
Awaited with feverish anxiety
What a disheveled and distraught figure he cut
They broke into pieces and fell on the ground,
The brunt of life
But this warns me
He suppressed every sign of surprise
This was a nimble-witted opponent
W
I look forward to pleasant personal relations in the future
And I beg of you
You may also be assured
She felt a rush of sensations
Susceptible to every impulse and stimulus
Do make a music like to rustling satin
The sentimental tourist will be tempted to tarry
Let me not be thought offensive
You see, it's all very vague
We hope that you will find the enclosed booklet very interesting
Her dusky cheek would burn like a poppy
But I trust that you will all admit
Railed at the world
And now supposing this point to be settled
You must not forget
Soft in their color as gray pearls
His reputation had suffered
Her expression changed with the rapidity of a kaleidoscope
Nor must I be understood as saying
An irrepressible and impassioned hopefulness
Bright as a diamond in the sun
I can not but see what mischief
But this we may put aside
I do not wish to be misrepresented
Softened by the solicitude of untiring and anxious love
A profound and absorbing interest
An unaccountable feeling of antipathy
It is commonly assumed
The first point to be ascertained
In regard to
A subjugated and sullen population
I take pleasure in replying to your inquiry concerning
It is a perfectly plain proposition
I could never understand
We do well to recall
I am giving you well-deserved praise
The radiant stars brooded over the stainless fields,
Sayings that stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet
Indeed, you are wholly wrong
I brazenly confess it
His face dismissed its shadow
Steals lingering like a river smooth
ready to snap at a touch
Perhaps he heard a faint accent of reproach
Her eyes were full of wondering interest
I was in a somber mood
It's all nonsense
Restless and sore and haughty feelings were busy within
Why did this happen to us
                                [phantasmagorical =  fantastic imagery]
In yonder cottage shines a light, far-gleaming like a gem
This thought is as death
Philosophy evolved itself, like a vast spider's loom
Is there any possibility of mistaking
A prey to the tongue of the public
Expressions of unrestrained grief
Does any man say
A swift unformulated fear
The sky was like a peach
It is on these grounds
On referring to your account we notice
You have such an interesting way of putting things
Served to recruit his own jaded ideas
I speak wholly without authority
Let me urge you earnestly
The tumult of pride and pleasure
F
I am quite discomfited
I remember a reference made
This is sickening
She faked incomprehension
I view that prospect with the greatest misgiving
Need I say that I mean
Two of them climbed up each pole
Regarded with an exulting pride
Like golden boats on a sunny sea
For this reason, indeed, it is
He loved life
M
The web of lies is rent in pieces
I think I am correct in saying
                              [peremptory = ending all debate or action]
Hopeful as the break of day
Infantine simplicity and lavish waste
I must take this opportunity to tell you
I have only partially examined
I shudder at the doctrine
What can avail
A random gleam of light
She spoke with hurried eagerness
Frightened like a child in the dark
I thank you for your thoughtful courtesy
As swaggering and sentimental as a penny novellete
I do not need to remind you
I do not disguise the fact
I am in a chastened mood
I hope we may meet again
Dogged and shameless beyond all precedent
A half-uneasy, half-laughing compunction
We can safely take it for granted
Having taken a view of
A stinging wind swept the woods
I have been trying to show
For I must tell you
I have somewhat overshot the mark
As a special favor we ask
Let me answer these questions
A ripple of applause
You will observe
Like a triumphing fire the news was borne
Impatience of despotic influence
The dress was too low-cut
No man regrets more than I do
Her voice trailed off vaguely
None can have failed to observe
The widest compass of human life
Milk-white pavements, clear and richly pale, like alabaster
The days passed in a stately procession
I have still two comments to make
To the scourging he submitted with a good grace
So my spirit beat itself like a caged bird against its prison bars in vain
That is inconceivable
And what is all this pother about?     [pother = commotion; disturbance]
So that if you were persuaded
The bird was preening its wings for a skyward flight
The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity
For the sake of my argument
I now proceed to inquire
I cannot explain it even to myself
Subject to the vicissitudes of fortune
It is just so far true
It is a staggering thought
He was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism
In a deprecating tone of apology
I don't want to exaggerate
Y
That is precisely what I mean
You are right to remind me of that
I beg to request that you give me some information
F
The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn
Deficient in affectionate or tender impulses
This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer
One assumption you make I should like to contest
She played with a hundred possibilities
It was a desolating vision
I can not thank you enough
Specious show of impeccability
I was lost in admiration
Days that are brief and shadowed
The simple rule and test
All the world was flooded with a soft golden light
In what I have now further to say
Now like a wild nymph she veils her shadowy form
Let me make use of an illustration
tired with a long summer day of eager pleasure and delight
A remarkable fusion of morality and art
Pure as the naked heavens
I am naturally overjoyed
His face lit with a fire of decision
Another instance of signal success
It requires no effort of imagination
The other day I observed
I regret exceedingly to inform you
A fatigued, faded, lusterless air, as of a caged creature
I have undertaken to speak
It is always pleasant to respond
I regard it as a very great honor
I hope by this time we are all convinced
I am well aware
You flatter my judgment
It always seemed to me impossible
I feel that I have a special right to
It took too long
An habitual steadiness and coolness of reflection
The evolution of events has brought
Affectation and superfluous ornament
Venerable and dignified conservatism
The future historian will, no doubt
Like cliffs which have been rent asunder
If you insist upon it
Stony insensibility to the small pricks and frictions of daily life
He jumped to conclusions too often
A stifling sensation of pain and suspense
I shall recur to certain questions
The baby gurgled in its carry cot
I have enlarged on this subject
Do you not know I am speaking of
I myself have boundless faith
Fostering and preserving order
                                                      [writhen = twisted]
I am asked to-night to propose
Hope was far and dim
Carried the holiday in his eye
But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly
Streaming tears, like pearl drops from a flint
In order to do justice to the question
The shop was full of trinkets
I can easily understand your astonishment
It is very amusing
She forced a faint quivering smile
The anguish of a spiritual conflict tore his heart
A boy full of dreams and hopes is a powerful force
He seems at times to confuse
Proud schemes for aggrandizement
Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets
Let us scrutinize the facts
Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise
Treasured up with a timid and niggardly thrift
To be sure, we sometimes hear
An answer to this is now ready
I have good reason for
The shadows rested quietly under the breezeless sky
The words did little to ease to his toiling mind
In amazed ejaculation
Men are telling us nowadays
A manner bright with interest and interrogation
I think I can sincerely declare
C
From the standpoint of serviceability
Lead to the strangest aberrations
Pray go on!
Delude not yourselves with the belief
Cast thy voice abroad like thunder
Current play of light gossip
P
She had a face as pale as wax
The wind piped drearily
Now, it is unquestioned
I will try to make the thing intelligible
Irritable bitterness and angry suspicion
I must conclude abruptly
Flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance
I have very much less feeling of
As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again
I am very sure that if you ponder
The sea heaved silvery, far into the night
A prevalent characteristic of her nature
He was praying intensely
Contending like ants for little molehill realms
The latest inclination I have seen
It exhibits a state of mind
The days when you dared to dream
We want you to read the booklet carefully
They are as cruel as creeping tigers
A lukewarm and selfish love
Seize on greedily
My own private opinion is
I am even bold enough to hazard
An object of indestructible interest
An inexpressible fervor of serenity
A glittering infectious smile was shared amongst everyone
I sincerely regret the absence
Drowned like rats
And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,
Is it not wise to argue
The reason is not so far to seek
Mainly, I believe
It is true none the less
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
As patient as the trees
I saw a face bloom like a flower
and sees only white peaks and pinnacles
They vanished like the shapes that float upon a summer's dream
I place myself entirely at your service
In the second place it is quite clear
Serenity of paralysis and death
A twinge of embarrassment
Twilight creeps upon the darkening mind
We shall feel compelled
Amid the direful calamities of the time
Breathed an almost exaggerated humility
J
Some very undignified disclosures
Struck dumb with strange surprise
The great mass of the people
But it may happen that I forgot
In a sky stained with purple, the moon slowly rose
I fully recognize
We have to admit
Do you really regard him as a serious antagonist?
It is not unknown to you
You take a great deal for granted
It is of course difficult
And it is doubtful if
There is a vital difference of opinion
We assure you of our confidence in the reliability
If you will forgive me the expression
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
They shine as sweet as simple doves
suddenly gave way like snow melting in the spring
When the fever pierced me like a knife
I resent that kind of thing
I hesitate to take an instance
Gain the applause of future ages
Like an engine of dread war, he set his shoulder to the mountain-side
like hounds about God's footstool
She will be immensely surprised
Plaudits of the unlettered mob
The lawyer's habit of circumspection and delay
Certainly I am not blind to the faults
                          [recrudescence = recurrence of a pathological
Therein lies your responsibility
I still view with respect
If we have not made everything perfectly clear, please let us know
The colored bulbs swung noon-like from tree and shrub
My life floweth away like a river
Please forgive my thoughtlessness
It is difficult for me to respond fitly
At your earliest opportunity
The time is now come for me
You speak in enigmas
But what a blunder would be yours
To a practised eye
They escaped the baffled eye
Now, I wish to call your attention
Like the visits of angels, short and far between
Some minds are like an open fire--how direct and instant
He had a deliciously tantalizing sense of the absurd
We continually hear nowadays
I must express to you again
But apart from the fact
It is perfectly defensible
Am I mistaken in this
But you are open to persuasion?
Awaiting your early communication
Microscopic minuteness of eye
The point to which I shall call your attention
It drops away like water from a smooth statue
A great pang gripped her heart
Ardent words of admiration
Ludicrous attempts of clumsy playfulness and tawdry eloquence
Like a cold wind his words went through their flesh
Incapable of flashy make-believe
Either way her fate was cruel
It is a living truth
Stretched out in dreary monotony
Airy swiftness of treatment
I can make allowance for
We are sorry to learn about your illness
Your heart is as dry as a reed
But, gentlemen, I must be done
Something full of urgent haste
Had I time for all that might be said
Your inquiry has just been received, and we are glad to send to you
The dinosaurs were on the slope towards extinction
Uncharted oceans of thought
Brilliant and gay as a Greek
I come next to the question of
Your frail fancies are swallowed up,
It is also probably true
It reminds me of an anecdote
The unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor
that can make the world a garden of enchantment
He was as splendidly serious as a reformer
Scornful of petty calculations
We couldn't have a better topic
The conversation became desultory      [desultory = haphazardly; random]
Sweet as a summer night without a breath
A mighty wind, like a leviathan, plowed the brine
I own I can not help feeling
A quibbling mouth that snapped at verbal errors
His gaze faltered and fell
Swift as the panther in triumph
I would venture to point out
In one sense this is undoubtedly true
The golden riot of the autumn leaves
I was hoping that I could persuade you
This is to be found in the fact
A powerful agitation oppressed him
An imminent and overmastering peril
The jargon of well-handled and voice-worn phrases
If you are thinking about ordering
This is so ridiculous
I am really gregarious
I am still holding this offer open to you
I speak the secret feeling of this company
It was not to be expected
In a sky stained with purple, the moon slowly rose
A face singularly acute and intelligent
When you did me the honor to invite me
I can not forbear from offering
The fruit of vast and heroic labors
You can never forget
But, above all things, let us
There were only some dim-remembered and dream-like images
If you want to look
Your eyes as blue as violets
He is the most guileless of men
I entertain great apprehension for
Kindle like an angel's wings the western skies in flame
But doubts here arise
A profound and eager hopefulness
It proved a bitter disillusion
The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings
Her blank gaze chilled us all
The idle of all hobbledehoys       [hobbledehoys = gawky adolescent boy]
Red is the new black
Pale and vague desolation
His plea was irresistible
These considerations have great weight with me
But my answer to this objection
But it has been suggested to me
I feel a certain apprehension
A face tempered like steel
Do I seem very ungenerous?
Her face was passionless,
I will merely mention
I am, gentlemen, yours faithfully
I cannot see how you draw that conclusion
Curiosity killed the cat
It is no part of my business
Little less than scandalous
A dead theological dogma
Submission to an implied rebuke
Inspired by the immortal flame of youth
Two things are made very clear
I use very plain language
There can be no doubt
Words as soft as rain
                                     [obeisance = attitude of deference]
I am compelled to, unluckily
The air was raw and pointed
Whence it is, I say
Hoping for a definite reply
Meaningless as the syllables of an unknown tongue
Once more I emphasize
She gave him a surprised look,
There is a degree of evidence
An insect crawled from his eyes
That reassures me
There has been a great deal of discussion lately
He clatters like a windmill
Kindly let us have your confirmation at your earliest convenience
As gently as withered leaves float from a tree
In most cases I hold
I might enter into such detail
Let me thank you for the opportunity
I look forward to pleasant personal relations in the future
Mere effects of negligence
Like the stern-lights of a ship at sea,
But when we look a little deeper
Squirrel-in-the-cage kind of movement
The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves,
We will devoutly hope not
Pursuant to your letter
We have an overpowering sense
Like a festooned girdle encircling the waist of a bride
Lovely as starry water
Full of speculation and a deep restrained excitement
We will make it a point to give your correspondence close attention
A species of moral usurpation
but can find no rest within a pure and gentle mind
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
Awkward as a cart-horse
They dropped like panthers
He had the eye of an eagle in his trade
                                    [sibilant = producing a hissing sound]
Then fall unheeded like the faded flower
Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened
Why do you take it so seriously?
Fierce as a bear in defeat
No longer do we believe
She was demure and dimly appealing
The machinations of an unscrupulous enemy
But that is beside the mark
It set his memories humming like a hive of bees
The margin of profit which we allow ourselves
Of course you will do what you think best
I am apprehensive about the future
A face as imperturbable as fate
I do not advocate
Hoping for a continuance of your interest
I should like to-day to examine briefly
And I am bound to say
He does me too much honor
His swift and caustic satire made him plenty of enemies
Complicated and infinitely embittered
We shall be glad to render you any assistance in our power
I decline to commit myself beforehand
N
It is difficult to surmise
V
So many requests of a similar nature come to us
Looking at the matter by and large
A jeweler that glittered like his shop
It is fair that you should hear
Peculiarly liable to misinterpretation
Let us take a concrete instance
I will only venture to remind you
But the necessity of the case
Like the cry of an itinerant vendor in a quiet and picturesque town
Unconscious as an oak-tree of its growth
For behold
Gorgeous as the hues of heaven
He bent upon the lightning page like some rapt poet o'er his rhyme
As the lightning cleaves the night
Marching down to posterity with divine honors
Some dim-remembered and dream-like images
And this leads me to say a word
I very rarely allow myself that pleasure
But let me before closing refer
We can not wonder
A stern decree of fate
I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken
Personally I confess to an objection
It's a matter of immediate urgency
And I submit to you
Let me direct your attention now to
I take one picture as an illustration
Stamping like a plowman to shuffle off the snow
Susceptibility to fleeting impressions
Strong as a bison
The river was in flood
He became more blandly garrulous   [garrulous = excessive and trivial talk]
A wild vivacity was in her face and manner
The invidious stigma of selfishness        [invidious = rousing ill will]
I am greatly alarmed
We will gladly accommodate you
I am not in sympathy with it
Stale and facile platitudes
We desire to effect a settlement
It is our very great pleasure to advise you
An ideal as sublime and comprehensive as the horizon
Neither should you deceive
Let his frolic fancy play, like a happy child
You are most kind
A reckless fashion
The day sang itself into evening
Be sure that in spite of
You're talking nonsense!
It is difficult to avoid saying
As simple as the intercourse of a child with its mother
Unsparing industry and attention
Of course we may, if we please
I am a little at a loss to know
He played with grave questions as a cat plays with a mouse
Impregnable as Gibraltar
The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity
I admit the extreme complexity
It ought to animate us
It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure
                   [mellifluous = flowing with honey; smooth and sweet]
A telegram is enclosed for your use, as this matter is urgent
These final words snapped like a whip-lash
A smile flashed over her face, like sunshine over a flower
Let us figure to ourselves
Requesting your kind attention to this matter
A broad, complacent, grin broke forth
Huge as a hippopotamus
The winnowed tastes of the ages
We all had moments of utter idleness and stupidity
This was a perfect crime of clumsiness
History is replete with predictions
On the face of it, it sounds reasonable
One is fairly tempted to wish
This brings me to a single remark
The haunting melody of some familiar line of verse
The lake glimmered as still as a mirror
Not at all
which interrupts the warbling birds among the leaves
I need not show how inconsistent
The panacea for the evils of society
I wish to do full justice to
But when it is declared
Shopping is such fun
A soothing and quieting touch was gently laid upon her soul
Rigid adherence to conventionalities
Here undoubtedly it is
Hard-souled and joyously joyous
A satisfied sense of completeness
I can not close without giving expression
That was intended ironically
She was conscious of a tumultuous rush of sensations
The foreground was incredibly shabby
And when I have shown to you
Paralyzed by infirmity of purpose
In order to complete the proof
Freighted with the most precious cargoes
And so, again, as regard
I know well the sentiments
As radiant as the rose
Nor must it be forgotten
Tremendous exploits and thrilling escapades
I have attempted thus hastily
I ask your indulgence
In an eminent degree
As you, doubtless, are aware
He paused, stunned and comprehending
I know you will interpret what I say
I even add this
I will endeavor to illustrate
The dentist said his teeth were fine
If I were to act upon my conviction
I will even go further and say
The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion
Like separated souls
Assuredly I do
Wearing their wounds like stars
Through the forest, like a fairy dream through some dark mind,
Women with tongues like polar needles
Language of excessive flattery and adulation
Silence fell on them all
Once again, there are those
I need not specially recommend to you
How very agreeable this is!
It is appropriate that we should celebrate
Agreeable to our conversation
I know it has been questioned
I trust that as the years roll on
An immeasurable advantage
Indeed, I am not convinced
Vivid even to oppressiveness
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph erupted
She spoke with sweet severity
stole the faint tinkle of a guitar
Fanatical and dangerous excesses
Let us devote ourselves
I will not try to gauge
We are perfectly willing to make concessions
A firm and balanced manhood was all he hoped for
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives
I am told occasionally
She was helpless
A civilizing agency of conspicuous value
Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation
If it be so
And now the question is asked me
Surely you will participate
The restlessness of offended vanity
He was haunted and begirt by presences
But the most formidable problem
Be it so
Indifferently so, I am afraid
Like the soft light of an autumnal day
If it be difficult to appreciate
That is what I meant to tell you
The fact to be particularly noted
Among many examples
The excitement had spread through the whole house,
These are enough to refute the opinion
To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn
Oddly amenable to the proposed innovations
You are very complimentary
The first thing I wish to note
As ruthlessly as the hoof of a horse tramples on a rose
Our enemies were broken like a dam of river reeds
It seemed so tragic
The woman seemed like a thing of stone
She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity
We shall be glad to have you tell us frankly
A sudden and stinging delight
Graceful length of limb and fall of shoulders
It is well known
Generous to a pathetic and touching degree
In this sense only
And spangled o'er with twinkling points, like stars
That way madness lies
It is a well known fact
I have acquired some useful experience
We have not, however, had the pleasure of hearing from you
Their troth had been plighted
I presume I shall have to admit
Delicate as the flush on a rose or the sculptured line on a Grecian urn
Unworthy and ungenerous treatment
Like pouring oil on troubled waters
Indeed, I can not do better
I speak with the utmost sincerity
I may seem to have been diffuse
It was so incredible
I shall be most proud and pleased
Collapsed like a concertina
Then the lover sighing like furnace
The deepening east like a scarlet poppy burnt
Seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes
Swift and vehement outbursts of feeling
I marvel that
You will, of course, remember the incident
As a child in play scatters the heaps of sand
I wish to say a word or two
The complex phenomena of life
I warn and exhort you
It will appeal to
It is an interesting fact
A little indulgence may be due to those
I am sure you will be kind enough
I think that, in these last years
Finely touched to the fine issues
I am very far from being a fanatic
I have watched with some attention
She shook hands grudgingly
His sensibilities were offended
It was a brilliant answer
He was most profoundly skeptical
Once again, like madness, the black shapes of doubt swing through his brain
I am suggesting the reason why
Happily for us
A rare precision of insight
We regret that this misunderstanding has occurred
Like echoes from a hidden lyre
Like a blast from the suddenly opened door of a furnace
A golden summer of marvelous fertility
Like lead his feet were
                           [importuned = insistent or repeated requests]
cover their faces with their wings
Like great black birds, the demons haunt the woods
The melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair
In that matchless epitome
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
Manifestly harsh and barbarous
Her clothes were just so cool
It defies description
I must consider this as
but their springs have been seen by but few
I take leave to say
I am so surrounded on every hand
A weird world of morbid horrors
It is a capital blunder
Rich and exuberant complexities
Suffered to languish in obscurity
Now, we do not maintain
Let us approach the subject from another side
I can not be content with
I greatly deplore
1
Calmly dropping care like a mantle from her shoulders
This privileged communication is for the exclusive use
His hands were small and prehensible
Dense to the point of stupidity
She fell into abstracted reverie
Crisp sparkle of the sea
What beautiful music she played
But I have heard it argued
Like an icy wave, a swift and tragic impression swept through him
On the whole, then, I observe
Answers doubtless may be given
The food had finally arrived
A bitterness crept into her face
1
SECTION VII
The fragrant clouds of hair, they flowed round him like a snare
The multitudinous tongue of the people
I abide by my statement
Pallor of reflected glories
Protracted to a vexatious length
An antagonist worth her steel
That is a natural boast
Yes, if you will be so good
Well, yes--in a way
Her eyes as bright as a blazing star
I close with the words
But everyone who deserves
Nights of fathomless blackness
Like a sea of upturned faces
Lofty and distinguished simplicity
Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon
A fatal moral hollowness
To feel the true force of this argument
The anemone that weeps at day-break, like a silly girl before her lover
Her eyes danced with malice
Like shy elves hiding from the traveler's eye
I should think it too absurd
The low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue
We suggest that this is an opportune time
I tell him in reply
It would be superfluous to say
The pith and sinew of mature manhood
That doesn't sound very logical
He sat on thorns
He had the eye of an eagle
The result of caprice
If, however, you determine to
On the edge of great irritability
It will be easy to say too much
What could be more captivating
Cherished the amiable illusion
If any other answer be made
Will you please give us your immediate attention
In moments of the most imminent peril
R
It must seem to every thoughtful man
One long torture of soul
From this statement you will perceive
There is no worse perversion
A mystery everlastingly impenetrable
On this subject you need not suspect
I hold it to be clearly expedient
I will now take an instance
And will you still insist
But it is impossible for one
Do not hesitate to let us know
A sound like the throb of a bell
As clear as the parts of a tree in the morning sun
It will be asked me how
Bound up with impossibilities and absurdities
I propose, therefore to consider
His mouth quivered with pleasure
Her tongue stumbled on the first syllable
Isn't it extraordinarily funny?
I may safely appeal
There are people in every community
It may be added
We are tolerably certain
I shall esteem it a personal favor
A fawn-colored sea streaked here and there
In honor spotless as unfallen snow
There are seven days in a week
He spent a little while in deep thought
We should lend our influence
I think that all will agree
As far as this is true
I have listened with the utmost interest
But it is not really so
The indulgence of an overweening self-conceit
It may appear absurd
Like the boar encircled by hunters and hounds
We beg a moment of your attention and serious consideration
Like an enraged tiger
I can only hope for indulgence
Slowly, unnoted, like the creeping rust
I think it is superb!
Like mountain over mountain huddled
I need not dwell
It is not out of place to remind you
If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning
Deep shame and rankling remorse
Like an unbidden guest
He flushed crimson
M
I have a profound pity for those
Nor do I believe
Constant as gliding waters
May I not speak here
A childish belief in his own impeccability
Bent like a wand of willow
If I were to recapitulate
Misgivings of grave kinds
In these extraordinary circumstances
Occasioned by direct moral turpitude   [turpitude = depravity; baseness]
Thine eyes like two twin stars shining
An eager and thirsty ear
He gazed at the dim light of the moon
Devious and perilous ways
Intimations of unpenetrated mysteries
And I say, it were better for you
An iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart
Let us, therefore, say once for all
A tone of arduous admiration
It is for you to decide
After a first moment of reluctance
The light was red
A sacred and indissoluble union
It seems unspeakably funny to me
Fields of young grain and verdured pastures like crushed velvet
The sun set suddenly
Freedom and integrity of soul
I value very much the honor
As the foregoing instances have shown
Uplifting their stony peaks around us
The guides sniffed, like chamois, the air
His soul full of fire and eagle-winged
M
A fluttering as of blind bewildered moths
I should not be satisfied with myself
He found this oddly disappointing and fickle
like bodies fallen there in vain assault
I call never sufficiently express my gratitude
Meantime it is encouraging to think
I ask you now to follow me
In deference to a unanimous sentiment
The menacing shadow of want
Like wasted hours of youth
I have been constrained by circumstances
The evil was irremediable
I can understand, moreover
I would agree if I understood
Degenerate into comparative feebleness
I think it quite admirable
Feigning a virtuous indignation
They seem like swarming flies, the crowd of little men
It will create a considerable sensation
P
Now, having spoken of
An almost excessive exactness
She was both weary and satisfied
It is not for me on this occasion
Sir, with all my heart, I respond
Alien to the purpose
Slowly as a tortoise
I was honored with the acquaintance
Pursued to a vicious extent
He swayed in the sudden grip of anger
In a flash of revelation it appeared before him
Insensible to its subtle influence
It affords me gratification
As clear as a whistle
Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake
seemed to go hand in hand like a happy aged couple
I can find no satisfaction in it
If I were asked
I am willing to accept all the consequences
We can remember with pride
We hope that we shall have many opportunities to demonstrate our ability
It would be the height of absurdity
For mark you
We are constantly being told
The hum of the camp sounds like the sea
Shapeless as a sack of wool
like the head and skin of a dying man
The day was sweeter than honey and the honey-comb
I have all but finished
He treads the primrose path of dalliance
Calm as the night
I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration
A heavy pall hung in the air
I understand your delicacy of feeling
If this be so
And yet though this be true
That must be exceedingly tiresome
The generous feeling that has promoted you
Bemoaning and bewailing his sad fortune
A source of unfailing delight and wonder
A car has four wheels
An inexhaustible copiousness and readiness of speech
This is the great fact
Will you pardon my curiosity?
Beguile the tedium of the journey
I shall certainly take you at your word
Such is steadfastly my opinion
Into her eyes had come a hostile challenge
I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it
Every phrase is like the flash of a scimitar
I suppose it to be entirely true
I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself
I submit that it is high time
Doomed to impermanence and transiency
I must take occasion to say
His brow was in his hand
The onrush and vividness of life
Every flake that fell from heaven was like an angel's kiss
The swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries
I dare say your intuition is quite right
I refer especially
In a most commendable fashion
The last and distinguishing feature is
And here allow me to call your attention
I am sure you all hope
This is obvious
It is my opinion you are too conscientious
I have sometimes wondered whether
We have a firm assurance
We must judge it leniently
May I venture to suggest
H
Doubt tortured him
Turn the volume up to eleven
I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable
                               
[peremptory = ending all debate or action]
The taint of fretful ingratitude
A dull collocation of words
The spell of a deathless dream was upon them
As inexorable as the flight of time
Wantonly and detestably unkind
I know you are all impatient to hear
The wind comes and it draws its length along
I hope they beam me up now
Long-sighted continuity of thought and plan
The night was drowned in stars
Vanish into thin air, like ghosts at the cockcrow
You would never dream of urging
I confess that my notions are widely different
The tumult in her mind found sudden speech
We will not stop to inquire
Dazzling white as snow in sunshine
I do not think we can go far wrong
But what do you yourself think about it?
Few things impress the imagination more
That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so
A servile mind can never know
Grooves of intellectual habit
I regard as an erroneous view
How infinitely superior must it appear
I am very confident
Another reason of a kindred nature
It was under these circumstances
I do not fail to admire
The clouded, restless, jaded mood
It has been a very great pleasure for me
And in conclusion
Her hurrying thoughts needed to be spoken
Enormities of crime and anomalies of law
In the air was the tang of spring
Yet I am willing to conclude
I cannot forbear to press my advantage
And to all this must be added
However, I should like to hear your views
The nascent spirit of chivalry
And I call on you
Justify it if you can
Easily moved to gaiety and pleasure
I do, indeed, recollect
Her lips like twilight water
A breach of confidence
I trust you will not consider it an impertinence
It is the doctrine of
I can not refrain from saying for myself
I wish to offer a few words relative to
Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate
When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze
I seize upon this opportunity
Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
It imposes no constraint
She softened her frown to a quivering smile
Creed of incredulity and derision
Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony.
I believe that I am within the mark
We must not be deceived
And last of all
Shall we complain
Entangled in theological controversy
Actuated by an unduly anxious desire
I may be permitted to add
                   
[pettifogging = quibbling over insignificant details]
It may not be altogether certain
Well may we explain
It certainly follows, then
I am privileged to speak to
T
We are totally at a loss to understand why you stole the biscuits
His whole face was lighted with a fierce enthusiasm
Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood
I beg your indulgence
The empurpled hills standing up, solemn and sharp,
I think, on the contrary
It is altogether probable
A noble and puissant nation       
1
 [puissant = with power, might]
We want to remind you again
Activities of the discursive intellect
He found himself day-dreaming
E
A total impression ineffable and indescribable
The desire of the moth for the star
It therefore astonishes me
Strenuous and conscientious endeavor
This is the sum
An inevitable factor of human conduct
These are generalizations
His heart asserted itself again, thunderously beating
I wander'd lonely as a cloud
You might apply to yourselves
His mouth quivered with pleasure
Let me give one parting word
Haughtiness and arrogance were largely attributed to him
There she soars like a seraph
Salutary in the extreme
I have been heretofore treating
Are we not startled into astonishment
Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties
One other circumstance
I doubt very much whether
I can not take it for granted
In compliance with your request, we are pleased to send to you
I should think it very unlikely
Like making a mountain out of a mole-hill
How like a saint she sleeps
The sky was as a shield
He was a lively and intelligent chap
Stem the tide of opinion
The stream forgot to smile
The murmur of soft winds in the tree-tops
It has more than passing interest
It seems almost desperate to think of
Herding his thoughts as a collie dog herds sheep
It racked his ears like an explosion of steam-whistles
                        
[excrescences = abnormal growth, such as a wart]
His gaze faltered and fell
Nor indeed am I supposing
Like summer's beam and summer's stream
The shafts of ridicule
What commonly happens is this
A secluded dreamer of dreams
I am indebted to you for the suggestion
The contagion of extravagant luxury
A microscopic care in the search of words
As the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods
A gush of entrancing melody
The sky grew ensaffroned with the indescribable hue that heralds day
And for myself, as I said
Fair and fleet as a fawn
I say frankly
An awe crept over me
He was ready and vigorous
Let us for the moment put aside
This is doubtless the truth
What would you expect me to do?
The plains to northward change their color
Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?
In a rapture of imagined ecstasy
The vast unexplored land of dreams
Enclosed please find a memorandum
Brown as the sweet smelling loam
His last illusions crumbled
Calm like a mountain brooding o'er the sea
A signal deed of justice
I do not mistrust
The common consent of civilized mankind
Yet I have never been thoroughly satisfied
Clouds like the petals of a rose
We heartily wish and mean
Your trial order is respectfully solicited
Buried in his library like a mouse in a cheese
In quest of something to amuse
The hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her
1
An endless field for discussion
A sordid and detestable motive
Thanking you for being so quick
But let me ask you to glance
Slowly disengaging its significance from the thicket of words
I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner
First in my thoughts are
A potential menace to life
I must say that I am one of those
A fugitive intangible charm
In precisely the same way
Immersed in secret schemes
Like the awful shadow of some unseen power
I trust that this will not be regarded as
                                     
[ephemeral = markedly short-lived]
That might involve you in life-long self-reproach
As if smitten by a sudden spasm
It blunts the sensibilities
This was unquestioning devotion
I had no intention of being offensive
Exploded like a penny squib
I rejoice in an occasion like this
A gusty breeze blew her hair about unheeded
It is not possible to recount
I feel it a proud privilege
As a flower after a drought drinks in the steady plunging rain
The malarious air of after-dinner gossip
It's going to be rather troublesome
She seemed wrapped in a veil of lassitude
I beg of you to remember
It occasions suspicion and discontent
Unspeakably alluring and satisfying
The facts took him by the throat
If we isolate ourselves
As readily and naturally as ducklings take to water
I ask you to join me in drinking a toast
A trifle prim and puritanic
It is gratifying to have the honor
I hold myself obliged to
A sonorous voice bade me enter
I will add the memorable words
A friend came over to play
With respect to what has been said
Politeness is important
I will not enumerate at present
A firmness tempered by the most scrupulous courtesy
That will suit me excellently
I do not mean to impute
Not so much polished as varnished
Stern emptying of the soul
She that passed had lips like pinks
Passionately addicted to pleasure
He declined the proffered hospitality
There is a conviction
In what has now been said
The vivifying touch of humor
I want to make some simple applications
The very pulsation and throbbing of his intellect
If more were needed to illustrate.
                             [peremptorily = ending all debate or action]
Despite her pretty insolence
The most implacable logic
I do not see how it is possible
I have known striking instances of the kind
Involuntary awkwardness and reserve
A specific answer can be given
If you wish to get at the bottom of facts
I call to mind how
1
Self-command born of varied intercourse
and became transmuted to silver sentinels
Sunk into a gloomy reverie
As I look around on this assembly
The afternoon was filled with sound and sunshine
Summer clouds floating feathery overhead
Like rowing upstream against a strong downward current
It seems to me idle to ask
It amounts to this
But on what ground are we
There are hopeful signs of
It was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye
I will say at once
I think we ought to recur a moment to
The property of little minds
The idle chatter of the crowd
Her eyes were full of wondering interest
I remember to have heard
Streamed like a meteor through the troubled air
As by a secret of freemasonry
The cat lapped it all up
But in the course of time
The only course that remains open
This brings us to a subject
Rushing and hurrying about like a June-bug
In compliance with your favor
Tell me in what way you want me to help you
Yes? You were saying?
I am persuaded by your candor
Pride working busily within her
Men of profound erudition           [erudition = extensive learning]
It is of very little importance
I am but saying
Consequently, I am not discussing this matter
Nay, I boldly say
Sunday mornings which seem to put on, like a Sabbath garment,
Maddened by a jealous hate
My last criticism upon
There has been no period of time
Suffer me to point out
I now come, sir, to the second head
Well, that is certainly ideal!
I wish, sir, that justice might be done
We have come together to-night
A gusty breeze blew her hair about unheeded
I will point out to your attention
Let us brush aside once for all
1
Suffice it to say here
It would seem perhaps most fitting
We should not question for a moment
Regulated by the fixed rules of good-breeding
Buffeted by all the winds of passion
It was a night of stupefying surprises
Scuba divers were everywhere
If we are rightly informed
Thickly the flakes drive past, each like a childish ghost
If, in consequence we find it necessary
Distinguished by hereditary rank or social position
He kept whipping the poor horse
I do not see much difference between
It may be worth your while to keep in view
In the twinkling of an eye
The cloak of cowardice
This is in the main just
Accept my best wishes
Love brilliant as the morning
I certainly have not so good an opinion
It seemed to exhale a silent and calm authority
By virtue of a common understanding
Injudicious and inelegant ostentation
It has been my privilege
O
1
I think it will astonish you
And it is strikingly suggested to us
We should dread nothing so much
Let us now consider the characteristics
I have all along implied
You yourselves are the evidence
Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea
My information is rather scanty
Really? I should have thought otherwise
Let us endeavor to understand
Awaiting the favor of your prompt attention
We can not have this too deeply fixed
But what we must needs guard against
I shall not end without appealing
I shall take it for granted here
However, I will not in any way admit
Her thoughts outstripped her erring feet
He threw round a measuring eye
I shall consider myself privileged
Impassive as a statue
The target for ill-informed criticism
I fear lest I may
1
The task has been placed in my hands
I stand in awed amazement before
Still we ought to be grateful
A dereliction of duty
Trees were planted all over the hillside
Socialized and exacting studies
The sky was dull and brooding
A grim face like a carved mask
Their eyes met glancingly
I might question all that
I do not argue
What conceivable reason is there for it?
Of course much may be said
The pent-up intolerance of years of repression
I would like to say one word just here
I shall often have to advert to
Treading close upon the heels
I think that none of us will deny
A life of studious contemplation
The computer never lies
I see it from a different angle
She was stricken to the soul
1
If we pursue our inquiries through
So that I may venture to say
I herewith submit my resignation
Paralysis and then death crept over it
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
Sudden and inexplicable changes of mood
Oppressed and disheartened by an all-pervading desolation
I might well have desired
A startling and unfortunate digression
An immortal spirit dwelt in that frail body, like a bird in an outworn cage
I have seen some signs of encouragement
The white seething surf fell exhausted along the shore
fitfully and discursively as a musician runs his fingers over a key-board
Can you ride a unicycle
Unrivaled gift of succinct and trenchant speech
Will you mistake this
Like a high-born maiden
It was purely an oversight on our part
I shall at once proceed to forget it
Let us imitate
He held his breath in admiring silence
As in the footsteps of a god
A quiver of resistance ran through her
Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve
It seems entirely wonderful to me
Why need you seek to disprove
She nourished a dream of ambition
Such, too, is the characteristic of
I am informed
Reverting to another matter
He was a man lavishly endowed with genius
A monstrous travesty
For, perhaps, some one may say
If I mistake not the sentiment
Yes, that is my earnest wish
His cheeks were furrowed and writhen like rain-washed crags
Childlike contour of the body
The mere reversal of the wheel of fortune
The collective life of humanity
I remember that song           
[limpidity = transparent clearity; easily intelligible]
It proves a great deal
N
1
The question, then, recurs
It proved a bitter disillusion
I have something of great importance to say to you
In the next place, be assured
One additional remark
Slow the movement was and tortuous
You are certainly justified in complaining
The purple heather rolls like dumb thunder
The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists
As iridescent as a soap bubble
Speaking in this place
Wholesale friction and discontent
The previous record was broken
Would you mind telling me your opinion?
An agreeably grave vacuity
It seems preposterous
A bloodless diplomatist
The sun is so much larger than the earth
Guilty of girlish sentimentality
                                      
[ephemeral = markedly short-lived]
Opinions are divided as to whether
I shall never believe
The chivalrous homage of respect
I will speak but a word or two more
A smile full of subtle charm
I don't know why you should be displeased
It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind
An excess of unadulterated praise
I sincerely wish it were in my power
                                                            
[kine = cows]
E
1
It is not entirely clear to me
I am giving the matter my personal attention
Nothing that you can do
Dignified by deliberation and privacy
Wrought out of intense and tragic experience
He was as wax in those clever hands
I have abstained from
You may remember
like the stretching of a sea-bird's wings
This, then, is the drift of my illustration
Impervious to the lessons of experience
I don't underrate his kindness
Chaste as the icicle
You are very gracious
It's very wonderful
There are many educated and intelligent people
Let us not limit our view
Her smile was faintly depreciatory
He felt an unaccountable loathing
Your early attention to this matter will oblige
His speech faltered again and again
Quite so
As society is now constituted
And here I wish you to observe
Let us resolve
An air of artificial constraint
His vagrant thoughts were in full career
I call hardly conceive
A gloom overcame him
A hot uprush of hatred and loathing
Now, the world will say
In the anomalies of fortune
If we had the whole case before us
on some hard, perfectly transparent day
I do not think it necessary to warn you
I am filled with admiration
Ceaseless tramp of humanity
I am persuaded
Resigned to growing infirmities
I very confidently submit
A silver moon, like a new-stamped coin, rode triumphant in the sky
The meticulous observation of facts
The silence seemed to crush to earth
I must not overlook
Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness
with a sound like smothered weeping
We ask for a continuance of your confidence
SECTION X
Let us hope and believe
Oh, that's mere quibbling
I now address you on a question
I shall bestow a little attention upon
I will dwell a little longer
We have been accustomed to
A soft intonation of profound sorrow
The general infusion of wit
like a friend in a crowd of strange faces
Familiar and endearing intimacy
They mistake the intelligence
Meantime soliciting your forbearance
I have never whispered a syllable
It enslaves the imagination
Quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water
The dupe of some imposture
You have been wrongly informed
I must not allow myself to indulge
A little weed-clogged ship, gray as a ghost
His accents breathed profound relief
Notoriously distracted by internecine jealousies
You are heartily welcome
You will be pleased to hear
Lamentable instances of extravagance
The outcome of unerring observation
A feeling of lofty remoteness
I flatter myself
We can imagine the amazement of
I am not aware of a single instance
Her voice cut like a knife
You all know the history of
The stillness of finality
Perhaps I am indiscreet
Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave
It is fair to suppose
Excuse my bluntness
I endorse it, every word
Let us now turn our consideration
Fanciful, I should say
Involuntarily she sighed
His hands were small and wrinkled
Unless you can give us reasonable assurance
Sweet smoke of burning twigs hovered in the autumn day
I have tried to convey to you
Implying an immense melancholy
I am confident that you will be thoroughly satisfied
Such, I believe, would be the consequences
Now, I am far from denying
He was so weak now, like a shrunk cedar white with the hoar-frost
One deep roar as of a cloven world
A
The sign said to come in
Curtains of opaque rain
Cruel as death
The stings of self-reproach
On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly
Her hands like moonlight brush the keys
U
The awful and implacable approach of doom
And now I have completed my review
I have pride and pleasure in quoting
It is a thing infinitely subtle
A curious feeling bothered her
But I digress
Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past
Your consideration is entirely misplaced
I am very much in the condition of
Trusting that we may have the pleasure of serving you
We have anticipated a heavy demand
There are, indeed, exceptions
Quivering like an eager race-horse to start
If I have done no more than view the facts
A slight and superficial tribute
And then there is another thought
The dark mass of her hair shook round her like a sea
On sure ground of fact
like a great looking-glass and shiver into a million pieces
One must be indulgent under the circumstances
The steadfast mind kept its hope
Perhaps, however, in speaking to you
He wandered restlessly through the house, like a prowling animal
To drag life on, which
I look with inexpressible dread
My friends, do you really believe
I should have forfeited my own self-respect
Ample scope for the exercise of his astonishing gifts
I am not dreaming of denying
Your argument is facile and superficial
Ambition shivered into fragments
I say not one syllable against
Black inky night
What we have most to complain of
And I will make a practical suggestion
A stream of easy talk
to give this matter my personal attention
It is the clear duty of
You are kind and comforting
This I have told you
Endowed with all those faculties
An open wit and recklessness of bearing
I make my appeal to
I desire to be brief
Whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire
As amusing as a litter of likely young pigs
We have no desire to adopt harsh measures
Microscopic analysis of character
A ruby like a drop of blood
On the horns of a dilemma
Her hair shone like a nimbus
G
He shifted his ground
It shall be as you wish
Therefore we are able to make you this offer
May I try to show that every effort
Your friendly and generous words
of a heavy sleeper after he has been called to get up
The creature and tool of a party
This is said in no spirit of
Like village curs that bark when their fellows do
Is it not quite possible
The times are full of signs and warnings
Let me ask your leave to propose
As unapproachable as a star
Many thanks--how kind and good you are!
                           [vicissitudes = sudden or unexpected changes]
Hoping to be favored with your order
An egregious assumption       [egregious = outrageously reprehensible]
We can not escape the truth
Continuous and stubborn disregard
Why ask such embarrassing questions?
Let me here say
It needs scarcely be said
I agree that something ought to be done
Caught unawares by a base impulse
I can only tell you the bare facts
The tranquil aspects of society
Cloudy mirror of opinion
I assure you, of my own personal knowledge
And the smile she softly uses fills the silence like a speech
Like vaporous shapes half seen
I am glad to notice
He sighed deeply, from a kind of mental depletion
Incredible little white teeth, like snow shut in a rose
And right here lies the cause
And now if I may take for granted
That is a superb piece of work
But this is what I mean
By common consent
An obscure thrill of alarm
A restraining and conservative force
We laugh to scorn the idea
An utterly vile and detestable spirit
How is this to be explained
His conscience tried to speak
The hand of time sweeps them into oblivion
In a word, I conceive
I feel an unwonted sense of gaiety         [unwonted = unusual]
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
Poured his heart out like the rending sea in passionate wave on wave
I grant with my warmest admiration
Rivers that like silver threads
Buried hopes rose from their sepulchers
I shall pass by all this
The kindness with which I have been received
The inflexible serenity of the wheeling sun
It was a worthwhile mountain to climb
There is something strangely interesting
Be not deceived
I can't sing in key
Intense and stubborn dogmatism
It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject
They seemed like floating flowers
I heartily feel the singular claims
Like blasts of trumpets blown in wars
                                       [invective = abusive language]
like a foam-flake drifting over the sea
Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve
T
I contend
Of course I would not allow
She seems uncommonly appreciative
I can not well avoid saying
Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day
The dance whizzed on with cumulative fury
The pristine freshness of spring
I haven't the remotest idea
In many instances
And let it be observed
Her imagination recoiled
The proof is in the eating
Those were his last words
The coughing went on for ages
Being persuaded then
Quietly as a cloud he stole
Browse the web whenever you like
His pulse leaped again
His lips seemed to be permanently parted in a good-humored smile
There was a time I might have trod the sunlit heights
Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue
I must return to the subject
It seems very ridiculous
All like an icicle it seemed, so tapering and cold
Winged like an arrow to its mark
I am not impervious to the obligations involved
We have not yet had time to sift the matter thoroughly
I question whether
His general attitude suggested an idea that he had an oration for you
In support of this assertion
And yet I feel justified in believing
I am far from asserting
I think you will all agree
I am extremely obliged to you
Driven towards disaffection and violence
You seem to be in a happy mood
It cuts like knives, this air so chill
The pull of soul on body
Oh, certainly, if you wish it
There is yet another distinction
I know just how you feel about over-eating
His curiosity is quenched
Rude and blind criticism
Let the facts be granted
Will you give us, in confidence, your opinion
To prevent misapprehension
She is easily prejudiced
Dear as remembered kisses after death
It is possible, but I rather doubt it
Like something fashioned in a dream
A decorous and well-intentioned person
And now having discussed
Sanity and quietness of soul
Hushed as the grave
An unknown world, wild as primeval chaos
I could ask for nothing better
By the sheer centripetal force of sympathy
Obviously at variance with facts
Your driving test is tomorrow
Consecration that like a golden thread
The eye of a scrutinizing observer
Isn't that a trifle unreasonable?
I must lament
I saw an ingenious argument the other day
An impudent trick as hackneyed as conjuring rabbits out of a hat
I have hitherto been adducing instances    [adduce = cite as an example]
With strength like steel
I am fortunate in being able to do you a service
There is a growing disposition
His eyes stared unseeingly
She had an undercurrent of acidity
Widely divergent social traits
I do not believe it possible
In like manner are to be explained
white with freshly fallen snow
We could see long tangled lines of silver
I think it has its charm
You will get the benefit of this liberal offer
The bewildered and tumultuous world
Her wariness seemed put to rout
I am sorry to say
I bow with you in reverent commemoration
He spoke with a uniformity of emphasis
I have hitherto been engaged in showing
I find numberless cases
You judge yourself too severely
It will not surely be objected
Lastly, I do not understand
I respectfully submit
Reluctant as we are to believe
They hurried down like plovers that have heard the call
She walks in beauty like the night
through every possible phase of violence and splendor
It is a matter of fact
On the horizon a sailing boat could be seen
A lapse from the well-ordered decencies of civilization
With an angry broken roar, like billows on an unseen shore, their fury burst
Slope towards extinction
I would desire to speak simply and directly
His bashfulness melted like a spring frost
I mean something more than that
Remember to eat your peas
She questioned inimically             [inimically = unfriendly; hostile]
Like lighting a candle to the sun
                                 [perfunctoriness = with little interest]
A disaster of the first magnitude
An acute note of distress in her voice
It would be unjust to deny
I will now consider with you
I am very grateful--very much flattered
It has been suggested fancifully
SECTION VIII
We are apt to forget
It is not enough to say
The headlong vigor of sheer improvisation
In widening our view
Like the prodigal whom wealth softens into imbecility
And thus it is conceivable
That is the question of questions
And why should I insist
Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings
Rafting is highly pleasurable
The blinding mist came down and hid the land
Plainly dictated by a lofty purpose
A mien and aspect singularly majestic       [mien = bearing or manner]
I have pleasant memories of
An enervating and emasculating form of indulgence
Transparent and ridiculous self-importance
Now, it is not at all strange
The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds
It is in this characteristic
Intervals of respite and repose
But I can at least say
Pulling the strings of many enterprises
The tempered daylight of an olive garden
He threw a ton's weight of resolve upon his muscles
A passage of extraordinary daring
There is no more striking exemplification
It is therefore necessary
No one, I think, will dispute the statement
She curled her fastidious lip
But what is the fact
Let's forget all this nonsense
A variety of conflicting and profound emotions
This matter has been considered very seriously
The pasta is cooked
I have an immense faith in him
The pressing question is
Loneliness struck him like a blow
Did you send your order yet?
An ardent face out-looking like a star
Lulled by dreamy musings
Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?
I have in my possession
He stood up suddenly
A violent and base calumniator
Her step seemed to pity the grass it prest
She lingered a few leisurely seconds
I am not in the least surprised
Dallying in maudlin regret over the past
He listened intently to all I had to say
Unspoken messages from some vaster world
It is incredible!
The dog raced the rabbit
It is said, and I think said truly
All the lesser lights paled into insignificance
Resting on some collateral circumstance
The seals were playing
He is so ludicrously wrong
We hope you will appreciate
This, surely, is the conclusion
You surely understand my position
All the world lay stretched before him like the open palm of his hand
F
Biting sentences flew about
If I may be allowed to refer
Don't barricade the road to truth
Her imagination went wild
I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions
It came and faded like a wreath of mist at eve
He would fall into the blackest melancholies
One concluding remark has to be made
The steady thunder of the sea accented the silence
Cowslips, like chance-found gold
The ravening wolves of brute instinct
Like apparitions seen and gone
Bursts of unpremeditated frankness
A cold, hard, frosty penuriousness was his prevalent characteristic
I am uttering no paradox when I say
His invectives and vituperations bite and flay like steel whips
We write to urge upon you the necessity
As a general rule I hold
The most absurd elementary questions
Treated the idea with lofty scorn
In very truth
Like the dawn of the morn
And if I may presume to speak
The youth of the soul
It does not necessarily follow
In the remarks I have made
I am obliged to add
Obscured with wrath as is the sun with cloud
She nodded mutely
                                [magniloquence = extravagant in speech]
An eternal and imperishable example
I see you are an enthusiast
Sensible diminution of our comfort
He is the best prophet who
I wish to state all this as a matter of fact
Not to my knowledge
We remain, dear sir, yours faithfully
Nor will history fail to record
The leaves syllabled her name in cautious whispers
You may depend upon it
Strictly speaking, there is no such thing
Beside himself in an ecstasy of pleasure
Who can say in a word
Permit me to bring home to you
March on my soul nor like the laggard stay
I anticipate your argument
It is not every wind that can blow you from your anchorage
No, I don't understand it
You rebuke me very fairly
All was incomprehensible
Have you anything definite in your mind?
As high as heaven
We shall do our best to correct the mistake
She moved like mirth incarnate
The effect too often is
I have not said anything yet
Like a star, unhasting, unresting
Her heart appeared to abdicate its duties
Such, in brief, is the story
Entirely futile and negligible
I neither affirm nor deny
I shall proceed without further preface
I gave notice just now
The stars looked down in their silent splendor
But after all, I think no one can say
We pride ourselves upon the fact
Involved in a labyrinth of perplexities
Consult me when you want me--at any time
Above and beyond and before all else
The exchange of harmless amenities
Your love shall fall about me like sweet rain
A powerful and persuasive orator
Senses of marvelous acuteness
The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell
I am unconscious of intentional error
I can not hesitate to say
I am quite convinced of that
Memories plucked from wood and field
Like a withered leaf the moon is blown across the bay
a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence
That you may conceive the force of
I give you, in conclusion, this sentence
I do not think myself obliged to dwell
In the dusky path of a dream
The chivalric sentiment of honor
Self-centered anxiety and preoccupation
                                                       [scanting = short]
But putting these questions aside
It was a spectacular accident
What are your misgivings?
But you should know
I do not, of course, deny
Like two doves with silvery wings, let our souls fly
Hardly less marvelous
She nestles like a dove
Here for a moment I seem
The chaotic sound of the sea
I sympathize deeply with you
Inveigh against established customs
It is a rare privilege
Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten
The velvet grass that is like padding to earth's meager ribs
As grave as a judge
You are quite delightful
I cheerfully own
I am ready to make great allowances
I have read with great regret
Vastly complex and far-reaching problems
The debilitating fears of alluring fate
Since, then, this is the case
or a forked flash of lightning
But I cherish the hope
The fog of prejudice and ill-feeling
Contemplating these marvelous changes
In its whole unwieldy compass
Thou as heaven art fair and young
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting
I shall await your pleasure
All silent as the sheeted dead
I said a little way back
The blackest abyss of despair
But mark this
I do not wish to be considered egotistic
I have generally observed
I am not surprised
It is a most extraordinary thing
His face was gravely authoritative
An unparalleled atrocity
And here let us recall to mind
I do not countenance for a moment
An assumption entirely gratuitous
Allow me to congratulate you
It is related
I will take one more instance
His eyes stared unseeingly
I am bound to secrecy
I am not without a lurking suspicion
The hobgoblin of little minds
He suffers nothing to draw him aside
I appreciate the significance
Suit the means to the end
As direct and unvarying as the course of a homing bird
We offer you the services of an expert
It is not often in these modern days
Dull black eyes under their precipice of brows
Like a jewel every cottage casement showed
The magical lights of the horizon
For observe what the real fact is
Coming to present circumstances
Here then, we are brought to the question
I hope the time may come again
I am quite conscious that
Like a world of sunshine
Question me, if you wish
A dandified, pretty-boy-looking sort of figure
Like music on the water
I hold this to be a truth
The flame of discord raged with redoubled fury
Old as the evening star
She disclaimed fatigue
I'll have an orange juice
The doctrine I am combating
I sometimes hear a wish expressed
There is my hand on it
It would be out of place here
The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth
I was overshadowed by a deep boding
A gloom overcame him
One fact is clear and indisputable
Laid down in a most unflinching and vigorous fashion
We are in receipt of your communication regarding
Like the drifting foam of a restless sea
Elephants never forget
I am appealing to your sense of humor
The sound of your running feet that like the sea-hoofs beat
Touched with a bewildering and elusive beauty
She had a haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
He could detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness
And here again, when I speak
She gave off antipathies as a liquid gives off vapor
I tell you, gentlemen
Impassioned and earnest language
Radiantly and transparently happy
The decided objection is raised
I say it most confidently
I will ask you to accompany me
I have incidentally dwelt on
Eyes half veiled by slumberous tears,
Obsessed with an overweening pride
Hangs like a blue thread loosen'd from the sky
Half-suffocated by his triumph
The immediate tyranny of a present emotion
As I dwelt like a sparrow among the spires
There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence
I adjured him      [adjured = command or enjoin solemnly, as under oath]
The sum and fruit of experience
As gay and busy as a brook
But to go still further
I don't care what you think
Never shop on an empty stomach
We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come
In response to your recent request
Redolent with the homely scent of old-fashioned herbs and flowers
To all intents and purposes
In very many instances
Let us not be misled
I would like a second helping
It is my grateful duty to address you
An air of inimitable, scrutinizing, superb impertinence
God be praised
If in the glow of conscious pride
Bright as the tear of an angel, glittered a lonely star
It was, therefore, inevitable
I speak from no little personal observation
Nor will I enlarge on the matter
flinging itself upon the shore
An unredeemed dreariness of thought
It is in the highest degree worthy
He danced like a man in a swarm of hornets
I do not imagine
I grant all this
A good balcony is at least six feet deep
I refuse to believe
No defense is to be found
An ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace
Her eyes, glimmering star-like in her pale face
She softened her frown to a quivering smile
Love like a child around the world doth run
There is not a shadow of evidence
like the thunder of a retreating storm
An apostle of unworldly ardor
Human nature interests me very much indeed
I have not accustomed myself
It would interest me very much
Like the cold breath of the grave
It must be a trifle dull at times
Let us not for a moment forget
Let me add my final word
Another signal advantage
Awaiting the pleasure of serving you
The pendulous eyelids of old age
Like the dance of some gay sunbeam
The incoherent loquacity of a nervous patient [loquacity = very talkative]
The pine trees are taller than the oaks
The most preposterous pride
A great sickness of heart smote him
A sharp difference of opinion
To these general considerations
The holiest and most ennobling sensations of the soul
Gravity pulled them downwards
A white bird floats there, like a drifting leaf
It is a popular idea
Pray don't apologize
Like the faint exquisite music of a dream
Love hovered in her gaze
Thus analogy suggests
The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind
A little breeze ran through the corn like a swift serpent
Bronze-green beetles tumbled over stones, and lay helpless on their backs
I will only speak to one point
But notwithstanding all this
In actual life, I suspect
But I would earnestly impress upon you
I need not enter into
Isn't it preposterous?
In this respect
The tortoise was older than me
The curl'd moon was like a little feather
The deepening twilight filled with shadowy visions
I am sure you will acquit me
It must be borne in mind
Difficult and abstruse questions      [abstruse = incomprehensible ]
The jaded weariness of overstrained living
I shall here briefly recite the
Like the quivering image of a landscape in a flowing stream
I do not know why
We have, as yet, no definite understanding
You are incomprehensible
Subtle suggestions of remoteness
I thank you very gratefully
Amiable and indulgent hostess
It is not likely that any of you
Dark with unutterable sorrows
It betrays a great want of prudence and discernment
We grope blindly along
No-one can eat faster than he can
I am vastly your debtor for the information
At this solemn moment
I hope it will not seem unreasonable to you
It strikes me with wonder
I have noticed of late years
The silver silence of the night
An ignoring eye
Did it ever occur to you
Deeds count more than words
The sun blazed torridly
Show me that the two cases are analogous
I see no possibility of
B
And is not this lamentable
Her head throbbed dangerously
Cherishing a huge fallacy
Nothing is more common in the world
I can never be sufficiently grateful
I, for one, greatly doubt
The orange pomp of the setting sun
E
Self-interest of the most compelling character
It took years to write the book
I
If we may trust to experience
Indeed, I have heard it whispered
Take it back for a refund
Rhetorical and ambitious diction
I do not myself pretend to be
that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun
I don't pretend to explain
Across the gulf of years
The want of serious and sustained thinking
with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock
A confused and troublesome time
This is owing in great measure to
But it is sometimes said
But I venture to assure you
My idea, therefore, is
There can be but one answer
A stinging wind swept through the woods
I frankly confess that
Don't be so rude
I can readily understand
Now, bear with me when I say
rung far down under the humming waters
Another reflection which occurs to me
She had lost her way in a labyrinth of conjecture
I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer
We desire to impress upon you
His shrewd gaze was fixed directly upon her
A vague aversion
I am entirely at your disposal
Position of titular command
A limpidity and lucidity of style
I am surely not here to assert
Dark trees bending together as though whispering secrets
His reputation had withered
Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven
He airily lampooned their most cherished prejudices
                                        [saturnine = melancholy; sullen]
I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?
Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on, like a mill
In a wise, superior, slightly scornful manner
Vehemently and indignantly repudiated
When we contemplate
Like dining with a ghost
A wind strayed through the gardens
He smote her quickening sensibilities
It is a melancholy story
I am reluctant to adopt such severe measures
It's past my comprehension
like a polished cocoanut
What are you going to do
The queen was loved by all
I need say nothing in praise
You undoubtedly are aware
But you must tell me more
An anxiety hung like a dark impenetrable cloud
An overburdening sense of the inexpressible
He hesitated for a while
Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty
An assumption which proved erroneous
Still one thing more
Like a vaporous amethyst
He was absolutely desperate
The smiling incarnation of loveliness
His curiosity was quenched
Acknowledging the receipt of your recent inquiry
The puddings are delicious
Selfishness pampered by abundance
Every one has asked himself
It is to be remembered
The belief is born of the wish
I know perfectly well
Shames us out of our nonsense
Indeed we know
It is said to be impossible
I am sure it sounds very strange to you
Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud
His face lit with a fire of decision
As the bubble is extinguished in the ocean
I purposely evaded the question
As brief as sunset clouds in heaven
The moonlight, like a fairy mist, upon the mesa spreads
I must hazard the story
I shall invite you to follow me
A great and many-sided personality
This is on the whole reasonable
Those clothes are wicked
whose thunder is its knell
Let us discard all prejudice
A strangely perverse and poverty stricken imagination
A cry as of a sea-bird in the wind
I shall now proceed to show
The wheel of her thought turned in the same desolate groove
The abysmal depths of despair
A request for further particulars will be welcome
We are satisfied regarding your statement
I was very much thrilled
Laughter like a beautiful bubble from the rosebud of baby-hood
Ears that seemed as deaf as dead man's ears
And I trust that you will consider
It is all very fine to think
All around them like a forest swept the deep and
The song of hurrying rivers
Hushed like a breathless lyre
This is charmingly new to me
B
I have pleasure in acknowledging
A day monotonous and colorless
If I mistake not you were there once?
What, may I ask, is your immediate object?
I can not here go into details
It is assumed as an axiom
The thought leaped
It is inexplicable
It surely is not too much to expect
Broadly speaking
Can it be supposed
The overweening exercise of power
     [vociferous = conspicuously and offensively loud]
We trust you will promptly comply with our previous suggestions
Vulgar eagerness for place
But I confess that I should be glad
I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness
I have some sort of fear
I have been insisting then on this
I know it will be said
The waves were rolling in, long and lazy, like sea-worn travelers
Take this example
I confess to a little embarrassment
Her skin was as the bark of birches
Intercourse with polished society
He shambled away with speed
Fathomless depths of suffering
You're so tremendously kind about it
We appreciate the order you were kind enough to send to us
Warnings too pregnant to be disregarded
How can you be so unjust?
Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste
The east alone frowned with clouds
We can but pause to contemplate
He would have basked in perpetual gloom
Fallen like dead leaves on the highway
Sensitive and apprehensive temperament
Fits and starts of generosity
A sense of deepening discouragement
I hear it sometimes said
We all had doubts and misgivings
Wrinkled and scored like a dried apple
In what case, for example?
I should be surprised if
I do not at this moment remember
It is rather an arduous task
Water flows faster than syrup
I am sure every impartial man will agree
Leaden mood of dulness
She saw this planet like a star hung in the glistening depths of even
Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me
Generosity pushed to prudence
Something indescribably reckless and desperate in such a picture
Mentally round-shouldered and decrepit
A quizzical look came into his incisive stare
Impromptu parades of noisy patriotism
I have been longing to see more of you
A settled conviction of success
We await an early, and we trust, a favorable reply
I know my request will appear singular
There are ten players on the team
But am I wrong in saying
Such is the intellectual view we take
Flame like a flag unfurled
Like a joyless eye that finds no object worth its constancy
I can not sufficiently thank you
Violating all decency
The school trip was a failure
I'm sure you will be quite satisfied
Like straws in a gust of wind
It will be rather to our advantage
At this juncture
In extenuation of the past
But this I fearlessly affirm
Her heart fluttered and stopped
                                  [prehensible = capable of being seized]
It elicited a remarkably clear and coherent statement
What is the pretext
My age is as a lusty Winter
The day was gracious
Looked back with faithful eyes like a great mastiff to his master's face
Has it really come to that?
The question drummed in head and heart day and night
We thank you for calling our attention
Silence that seemed heavy and dark; like a passing cloud
Wrapped in an inaccessible mood
For your further information we take pleasure in sending to you
A rigid avoidance of extravagance and excess
And thus consistently
It has never occurred to me
Conditions make it obligatory for us
The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses
I am simply endeavoring to show
Remember, I do not seek to
She hed a campaign of unbridled ferocity
The haunting phrase leaped to my brain
In spite of the fact
We would appreciate an answer
Let me call attention to another fact
Here is another strange thing
A life as common and brown and bare as the box of earth in the window there
You don't seem very enthusiastic
A flippant rejoinder
                             violet-blue, or greenish-blue gemstone]
It can rightly be said
Insolence was his only weapon
Information has just reached me
An ineradicable love of fun and mystification
I have long ago insisted
rustle their pale leaves listlessly
K
His gaze searched her face
Attended by insuperable difficulties
empurpled masses of her tangled hair
More and more it is felt
After very carefully considering
His work was ludicrously perfunctory
I desire to know
Passed like a phantom into the shadows
The hills across the valley were purple as thunder-clouds
dragged upon her spirits like leaden weights
We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds
like chance flowers flung upon the river's current
The indefinable yearning for days that were dead
Fear held him in a vice
Darkly insinuating what may possibly happen
A half-breathless murmur mixed amazement with incredulity
They were all so afraid
This is the starting-point
Let us be quite practical
Brief ventures of kindliness
I am afraid I must confess my ignorance
A foreboding of some destined change
We shall be pleased to receive the remittance
How much does one pay for this sweet
I need not say how much I thank you
Forever sings itself in memory
Oppressed by some vague dread
I cut my reflections adrift
Birds were fluting in the tulip-trees
True, I forgot!
Then the question arises
Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes
Our vaunted civilization
An interchange of civilities
Let me simply declare
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
This is why I take the liberty
I wish to give these arguments their full weight
I really can not think it necessary to
And to return to the topic
Or shedding radiance like the smiles of God
His speech faltered
Polished beauty of diction
Let me rather make the supposition
A cheap and coarse cynicism
The huge and thoughtful night
I must thank you once more
The clamorous agitation of rebellious passions
His passions vented themselves with sneers
A reputation that swelled like a sponge
Unlikely to be so
But it is not my intention
I am reluctantly but forcibly reminded
The important thing is
Pleading the exigencies of strategical interest
I remember the enjoyment with which
Immunity from criticism and control
My regret is intensified by the thought
Screen themselves from punishment
Beautiful as the dawn, dominant as the sun
He went hot and cold
He was utterly detached from life
I know I am treading on thin ice
I use the word advisedly
Her head throbbed dangerously
I never heard anything so absurd
As the long train sweeps away into the distance we sleep
An almost riotous prodigality of energy
All sounds were lost in the whistle of air humming by
The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought
He was hungry and thirsty
These are general counsels
May we be favored with a reply
H
You have been mindful
I must reply to some observations
The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life,
The subject of the evening's address
I take this instance at random
He submitted in brooding silence
What do we gain by
She looked so sad
It wears a ragged and dangerous front
Of this statement I will only say
Unquestionably superior
I have been decidedly impressed
I want to interest you
You have my deepest sympathy
No one can, I think, pretend
These exceptions do not hold in the case of
An argument has often been put forward
He murmured a civil rejoinder
an atmosphere of divine quietude
An air half quizzical and half deferential
There was one remarkable incident
That is true and I think you are right
Humming-birds like lake of purple fire
I leave the arduous task
Having thus described what appears to me
Aloof from the motley throng
when the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze
The sea-sweep enfolds you, satisfying eye and mind
This is what may be objected
Her life had dwarfed her ambitions
Now, the answer we should give
Coming back to the main subject
Coming down to modern times
A vanishing loveliness as tender as the flush of the rose leaf
He never suffered fever of enthusiasm
You're succeeding admirably
A hideous absurdity
Complying with your request
It is not evident
Beaming with pleasurable anticipation
The bogey of bad luck    [bogey = evil or mischievous spirit; hobgoblin]
It is self-evident
Here is no question
I will speak plainly
Pardon me, I meant something different
Like a blade sent home to its scabbard
But I am willing enough to admit
  [sycophant = servile self-seeker attempting to win favor by flattery]
So far so good
And here let me define my position
Taken in their totality
Of course, but that again isn't the point
They became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical
I find myself called upon to say something
An unerring sense of humor
And the same holds good
It is a true saying
It is now high time for me
I have always listened with the greatest satisfaction
I didn't mean that--exactly
Her heart was full of speechless sorrow
His fingers were knotted like a cord
I noticed incidentally the fact
       formed by a burning wick; to burn low and unsteadily; flicker]
His words trailed off brokenly
I can scarcely concede anything more important
Among the distinguished guests who honor
I have a hundred reasons for thinking so
A deep authentic impression of disinterestedness
Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance
Like an enthusiast leading about with him an indifferent tourist
Feverish tide of life
I am agitated by conflicting emotions
I know that what I may say is true
It is natural to ask the question
The flippant insolence of a decadent skepticism
L
Her eyes were blue
She fled like a spirit from the room
The trees rustled and whispered to the streams
We are very anxious to have you try
Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression
A patchwork of compromises
Burns like a living coal in the soul
I have the honor to remain
It was worth its weight in gold
Power of intellectual metamorphosis
This is precisely what we ought to do
Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by
Those are such handsome eyes
Leisure is one of the higher aspirations of life
But I pass that over
It was a book to beguile the tedious hours
If you wish for a more interesting example
Here then I take up the subject
It was a desolating vision
I respectfully counsel
D
The wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay
I am still holding this offer open to you
Sometimes it may happen
Intense love of excitement and adventure
Many of us have had the good fortune
Be your interests what they may be
We hope you will excuse the unavoidable delay
M
T
He snatched furiously at breath like a tiger snatching at meat
It will, I suppose, be denied
These eyes like stars have led me
And day peers forth with her blank eyes
A feminine excess of inconsequence
I have never heard it suggested
She hugged the thought of her own unknown and unapplauded integrity
A mysterious and an intractable pestilence
I confess it affects me very deeply to
A propitious sky, marbled with pearly white
The stars lay on the lapis-lazuli sky
Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently
The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings
I hardly dare to dwell longer
Like some new-gathered snowy hyacinth,
So far in general
Heavy was my heart as stone
like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain
I am inclined to suspect
When the profane voices are hushed
I have witnessed the extraordinary
Endless and intricate technicalities
Let us take, for instance
Gnawing at the vitals of society
Cleansed of prejudice and self-interest
I rather look forward to a time
Night falls like fire
Dull as champagne
It will be idle to imply
It is told traditionally
R
like sudden smilings of divine delight
I know that this is the feeling
It is an established rule
Bounded by the narrow fences of life
Aided by strong mental endowments
Suddenly swelled to unprecedented magnitude
E
Struck incessantly and remorselessly
Carried into port by fair winds
Can there be a better illustration
A rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy
Is it not legitimate to recognize
Let me be allowed to devote a few words
She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse
If you think for a moment
Have I incurred your displeasure?
The fastest rider normally wins
Tamed and wonted to a settled existence
                           symptoms after a period of improvement]
Nor is it a fair objection
Infected with a feverish dissatisfaction
Scotched but not slain
Respect forbade downright contradiction
You are not seriously displeased with me?
the ferns in branching beauty stream
The sun on the sea-wave lies white as the moon
Tinseled over with a gaudy embellishment of words
There is nothing more repulsive
This is really not a laughing matter
You must understand I do not mean to claim
That is a further point
We shall await your reply with interest
Please accept the thanks of the writer
The unmasked batteries of her glorious gray eyes
I have been asked several times
I could easily mention
I will endeavor to show you
But we think it is not wise
What I object to is
I think I can answer that for you
Dangerously near snobbery
But across it, like a mob's menace, fell the thunder
Gathering all her scattered impulses into a passionate act of courage
If we are not blind to
Now, let us consider
I find my reference to this
The naked fact of death
How do you account for
With our best respects and hoping to hear from you
The garb of civilization
The machinations of a relentless mountebank
Like the embodiment of a perfect rose, complete in form and fragrance
I dare venture the remark
We suggest that you consider
It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound
To me it's simply outrageous
The very texture of man's soul and life
I take that for granted
Worn to shreds by anxiety
I only wish you to recognize
Strictly in confidence, I do not think
I think you have summed it up perfectly
Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale
In this chastened mood I left him
Beauty maddens the soul like wine
Moreover, I have insisted
Leapt like a hunted stag
That is all that it seems necessary to me
I am sure you will do me the justice
It seems strange to be told
A broad, complacent, admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
Returning, then, to the consideration
If I may venture to say anything
Bandied to and fro
Wholly alien to his spirit
The radiant serenity of the sky
We believe that if you will carefully consider the matter
Vague as a dream
We always endeavor to please
The bounding pulse of youth
I took the good day from the hands of God as a perfect gift
Disenchanting effect of time and experience
He reached the summit
A great process of searching and shifting
An instant she stared unbelievingly
It is a strange fact
In such cases, strictly speaking
Nor am I disparaging or discouraging
I sympathize most heartily
And you may also remember this
Everyone loved the dolphin
I'm sorry I can't fulfil your wishes
In short, I say
I might go further
It will be easy to trace the influence
It is hardly for me
Our opinions were diametrically opposed
                      [penuriousness = stingy; barren; poverty-stricken]
Touched every moment with shifting and enchanting beauty
Let me thank you once more
Like thistles of the wilderness, fit neither for food nor fuel
Eyes as luminous and bright and brown as waters of a woodland river
Surely you would not countenance that
It is now perfectly plain
Her life had dwarfed her ambitions
No one, I suppose, would say
Again, can we doubt
I do not ask you to
This is essentially an age of
I shall be told
A life, a Presence, like the air
The proof is in this fact
His eyes were blue
His tone verged on the ironical
Y
A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight
Cold, glittering monotony like frosting around a cake
Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon
Endeavoring to smile away his chagrin
Rattle in the ear like a flourish of trumpets
Endearing sweetness and manner
A constant stream of rhythmic memories
Perhaps it may be doubted
The pleasure is certainly not all on your side
His retort was like a knife-cut across the sinews
The accident was fatal
The everlasting deluge of books
Red cars are involved in lots of accidents
I am not inquisitive
Affected an ironic incredulity
A solemn glee possessed my mind
Stopped as if on the verge of profundities
Beguiled the weary soul of man
The memory of the night grew fantastic and remote
It is peculiarly befitting at this time
We assume that you are considering acting as a career
Under the vivifying touch of genius
I understand exactly how you feel about it
We are sending to you by mail
A slight movement of incredulous dissent
Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility
I have the tickets already
That is the prevailing idea
The retort leaped to his lips
I don't want to disguise that from you
As I rise to respond to the sentiment
The whole story of civilization
I surmised as much
His passions vented themselves with sneers
The vast and shadowy stream of time
I can sympathize with you
Proof of his imperturbability and indifference
In consequence it becomes a necessity
Smooth as a pond
A thought occurred to me
In a tone of after-dinner perfunctoriness
As a cloud that gathers her robe like drifted snow
An irritating and dangerous treatment
It was a great party
Is it possible, can it be believed
W
Thou must wither like a rose
The paramount consideration is
Are you a trifle--bored?
and makes his way through temple, tower, and palace
Too puerile to notice
It was a matter of notoriety
The severest shocks of adverse fate
But I do say this
Let me tell you an interesting reminiscence
I suspect that is why we so often
I have barely touched some of the points
Enjoyed with astonishing unscrupulousness
White as the sea-bird's wing
The soundness of this doctrine depends
I have pointed out
Innumerable starlings clove the air        [clove = split]
He laughed away my protests
I always delight to think
The sweet smoke of burning wood made my day
An inborn and irresistible impulse
It has consistently been our aim to help our customers
We are drifting away from our point
His indifference fell from him like a garment
Ministering to mere pleasure and indulgence
The bound of the pulse of spring
The prevalent opinion, no doubt
He was entangled in a paradox
The silver birch is a beautiful tree
I mistrust these wild impulses
The facts may be strung together
I have been glad to observe
This is the main point on which the inquiry turns
I claim a share also for
This is especially the case
Please continue to be frank
I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say
A spirit of complacent pessimism
I find it absorbing
I even venture to deny
Bred in the tepid reticence of propriety
We shall have no difficulty in determining
Lofty as a queen
Cloaked in prim pretense
At first blush it may seem fantastic
The consequence of ignorance and childish assumption
I do not think it unfair reasoning
It may be rightly said
Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp
Sweet as the smile of a fairy
It ran as clear as a trout-brook
The deep and solemn purple of the summer night
Overshadowed by a vague depression
The mountain shadows mingling, lay like pools above the earth
Her sweetness halting like a tardy May
I class them altogether under the head
Cautious and practical thinkers ask
In the ordinarily accepted sense
Like kindred drops mingled into one
These points should be carefully considered
A compassion perfectly angelic
A strong susceptibility to the ridiculous
It was an accident
I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that
It is not easy for me to find words
Die like flies
Night passes lightly in the open world,
His sense of humor is unquenchable
I have said over and over again
A hushed rustle of applause testified to a widespread approbation
Untouched by the ruthless spirit of improvement
If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly
Evidently malicious and adroit
I wish to confine what I have to say
A great pang gripped her heart
Overhead the intense blue of the noonday sky burst like a jewel in the sun
Here I end my illustrations
They look like rose-buds filled with snow
I have often marveled at your courage
Motionless as a plumb line
As familiar to him as his alphabet
Faces pale with bliss, like evening stars
The bee stung once, then again
A first faint trace of irritation surfaced
Let me say a practical word
Dogging them like their own shadow
A further objection is
The summit of human attainment
We understand your position
Fresh as a jewel found but yesterday
illuminating only the path which has been passed over
Deeply engrossed in congenial work
I hope to be forgiven if
I have no intention to moralize
I feel keenly myself impelled by every duty
I know well it is not for me
We are always glad to furnish information
It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it
That is such a hideous idea
I could enlarge upon it
Lights gleamed there like stars in a still sky
Haunts you like the memory of some former happiness
He made a loathsome object
And if I know anything of my countrymen
Sufficient to repel vulgar curiosity
I am going to make a confession
You are rather puzzling to-day
Her limbs ran to marble
Weary wind, who wanderest like the world's rejected guest
A soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst
The pulse of the rebounding sea
Accustomed to ascribe to chance
Ruddy his face as the morning light
Of this truth I shall convince you by
She watched him stonily out of flint-blue eyes
Striking with the force of an engine of destruction
In answering your inquiry regarding
And lest anyone should marvel
His mind was like a lonely wild
Dimly implying some sort of jest
I shall not go so far as to say
It was total humiliation
Spectacular display of wrath
Are you not complicating the question?
We are met to-night
Floating in the clouds of reverie
There slowly rose to sight, a country like a dragon fast asleep
Like a blast from a horn
But I look at the practical side
I must confess I have never thought of that
We stand astonished at
I am nevertheless too sensible
Her pale robe clinging to the grass seemed like a snake
But who could foresee what was going to happen?
Let us suppose, for argument's sake
Kingdoms melt away like snow
His patience was worthy of admiration
In a spirit of indulgent irony
Her eyes dilated with pain and fear
I will now leave this question
I look with mingled hope and terror
This language is plain
Will you permit me a brief explanation?
Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies
I say, then, my first point is
It is an odd jealousy
Taking the larger sweeps in the march of mind
Vanished like snow when comes a thaw
I have now said all that occurs to me
To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood
We had no experience of the facts of life
These were strange, vague longings
This is the obvious answer
I know not how else to express
For some years past
I think I have a right to look upon
I avail myself of the opportunity
In a misery of annoyance and mortification
Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets
There is, at any rate, to be said
Now you are flippant
As the loud blast that tears the skies
The house plants needed to be watered
I readily grant
I have heard it objected
The grass must be mown every week
Transcend the bounds of human credulity
Who that reads does not see
Immediate and effectual steps
Rely upon it
She shook hands grudgingly
Amazing as it may seem
                           [vicissitudes = sudden or unexpected changes]
What a crop of disappointments
Lionized by fashionable society
This is not the main point of objection
And further, all that I have said
The panorama of history
The impulse of prejudice or caprice
In the local phrase
So, too, I may go on to speak
Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism
Like a dream she vanished
Holding this view, I am concerned
I am not unaware
Like fragrance from dead flowers
Unfeigned astonishment and indignation
I need to guard myself right here
He bolted down the stairs like a hare
I adduce these facts          [adduce = cite as an example]
Do I presume too much?
Flouted as unpractical
Here, then, we are involved
It could never conceivably be anything but popular
Setting all the sane traditions at defiance
Like a thing at rest
Daily usages and modes of thinking
Frosty thraldom of winter                 [thraldom = servitude; bondage]
It dissipates every doubt and scruple
I hope I shall not be told
Throw the ball to her now
If I may be allowed a little criticism
What are we to think of
But I will allude
With exaggerated gallantry he held open the door for her
She had a rare and dazzling beauty
It is a familiar charge against
runs through the warp and woof of one's life
A cleanness and probity of life   [probity = integrity; uprightness]
Kindly endorse your reply on the enclosed sheet
The roofs with their gables like hoods
I am too well aware of the difficulties
In order to facilitate our future transactions
A veritable spring-cleaning of the soul
Agitated and perplexed by a dozen cross-currents of conflicting tendency
But here I am discussing
I give you my most sacred word of honor
Pillowed upon its alabaster arms
When I hear it said
Like a swift eagle in the morning glare
Eyes like a very dark topaz
Talking and thinking became to him like the open page of a monthly magazine
Plunged into tumultuous preoccupation
That is so wasteful
What is this but to say
And if a man could anywhere be found
I thank you for the honor
Our stock has been temporarily exhausted
His voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes
They are as white swans in the dusk, thy white hands
Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle
With a sting like a scorpion
It has been generally assumed
But depend upon it
The spacious leisure of the forest
I appeal to any man to say
I would further point out to you
I wish to confirm my letter
I am to speak to you this evening
As faint as the memory of a sound
Does it please you so tremendously?
A puerile illusion                 [puerile = immature; childish]
Thank you for telling me that
Beach holidays are for the whole family
I will not repeat the arguments here
She was oppressed by a dead melancholy
I wish to put things as plainly as possible
I have been too long accustomed to hear
In the nature of things
She was babbling like a child
The illustration is analogous
She was a solid worker
Expectation darkened into anxiety
I do not say this with any affectation
It will not take many words to sum up
Those eyes like bridal beacons shine
I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense
It is easy to instance cases
In one point I wish no one to mistake me
I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude
It is curious sophistry
One can not decline to note
We hasten to acknowledge the receipt
Absurd and inconsequential career
And I would, moreover submit
There is an air about you like the air that folds a star
Far from it
It is extremely interesting, I can assure you
There was a blank silence
I recall another historical fact
In accordance with your request
Before I come to the special matter
It is quite conceivable
We take pleasure in explaining the matter you asked about
A stern foe of snobbishness
I am certainly in earnest sympathy
Her hair was like a coronet
The shiver of the dusk passed fragrantly down the valley
We need not look far for reasons
Silly displays of cheap animosity
We feel assured that you will appreciate
The air was full of fugitive strains of old songs
His words were ugly and unnecessary
Before going further
I want to say just a few words
If I have in any way deserved
I know that it is impossible for me to
And there is also this view
Patently inimical to liberty
I wish to be allowed to enforce in detail
In the heyday of friendship
The earth was like a frying-pan, or some such hissing matter
The air was full of the cry and clamor
A rare and dazzling order of beauty
I am far from believing the maxim
The cardboard is thick enough
Like young lovers whom youth and love make dear
I am not taking into account
An authoritative and conclusive inquiry
I bear no malice about that
I dissent from the opinion
An incongruous spectacle
Consider, I beg you, what
Shivering pine-trees, like phantoms
Transcendental contempt for money
The internet is incomprehensible
I am greatly indebted to you
Ran like a young fawn
That is not to be lightly spoken of
Gaze dimly through a maze of traditions
You will admit I have some provocation
Take another instance
Here is a complete answer to your question
The demerit of an unworthy alliance
Beyond all question we
A pernicious and growing tendency
His stupid ideas awoke again
The mocking echoes of long-departed youth
It was a compromise
Still as death
Who does not like to see
The voice that rang in the night like a bugle call
I am exceeding my necessary limits
Instantly alive to the slightest breach of decorum
What a tiny bikini
The straightforward path of inexorable logic
Forebodings possessed her
A prop for my faint heart
Deeply rooted in the heart of humanity
And unquestionably
The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night
He was an eminent instance of
I say this is no disparagement of
The river ran darkly, mysteriously by
Like an alien ghost I stole away
Suddenly smitten with unreality
In an eminent and unique sense
Like a damp-handed auctioneer
There was a kind of exhilaration in this subtle baiting
I don't feel that it is my business
In a significant paragraph
There is no page of history
I have thought it incumbent on me
Stigmatized as moral cowards
I have been favorably impressed by your toupee
He was dimly mistrustful of it
Shaken off like a nightmare
The floor, newly waxed, gleamed in the candle-light like beaten moonbeams
Howling in the wilderness like beasts
which straightway closes the wound with a pearl
It is not my intention to enter into
P
Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so
I trust I shall hear from you soon
An optimistic after-dinner mood
Suddenly a thought shook him
Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm
Isn't it amazing?
Always observant and discriminating
Outward mark of obeisance and humiliation
He felt no emotion
But that is not all
We need not trouble ourselves
I thus explicitly reply
I rise to thank you
It is a great pleasure to me
An assurance of good-nature that forestalled hostility
We owe you a debt of gratitude
The next question to be considered is
In a tone of uneasy interrogation
Here in statue-like repose, an old wrinkled mountain rose
The companion of a noble and elevated spirit
Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods
The majestic solemnity of the moment
This being undeniable, it is plain
But this I know
I feel it my duty to be frank with you
Here is your opportunity
Pledged with enthusiastic fervor
The calm white brow as calm as earliest morn
Do we not know
There is no mistaking the purpose
As the long train sweeps away into the golden distance
He writhed in the grip of a definite apprehension
I have felt it almost a duty to
It seemed intolerably tragic
I yielded to the ingratiating mood of the day
In a fever of apprehension
The delicatest reproof of imagined distrust
I do not indeed deny
Like a deaf and dumb man wondering what it was all about
Admit the soft impeachment
Her limbs felt like jelly
I suppose there is no one here
Like the bubbles on a river sparkling, bursting, borne away
I may say to you calmly
A vigilant reserve
Shy as the squirrel
Tyres contain rubber and steel
Habits of unintelligent routine
The three pigs chatted amongst themselves
We regret to be compelled for this reason to withdraw the privilege
Under these favoring conditions
Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread
Let these instances suffice
In the tone of one who moralizes
I am more grieved than I can tell you
There is one inevitable condition
Relatively speaking
The setting of the sun is like a word of peace
I would fain believe                       [fain = happily; gladly]
You are a severe critic
In pursuing the great objects
Sudden sprays of rain, like volleys of sharp arrows,
Immense capacity for ceaseless progress
like a full orchestra playing under the sea
All that is conjecture
The officials made his life a misery
I can not resist the train of thought
Through a cycle of many ages
Nor can we afford to waste time
You interest me deeply
Covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance
His words gave a curious satisfaction,
I mean, moreover
Since, then, it is provided
Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame
The hoofs of the horses rang like the dumb cadence of an old saga
His ears sang with the vibrating intensity of his secret existence
Arbitrary assumption of power
It is little more than a platitude
I take two views of
Her hair dropped on her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam
You must not fail to command me
Clever and captivating eloquence
I can strongly recommend
A murmur of complacency
Capable of a severe scientific treatment
In the last suggestion
It is a good augury of success  [augury = sign of something coming; omen]
Recently we had occasion
Take the simple fact
The television had been on for an hour
was wont to come and go like a flash of light
Fortunate, to say the least
Such, then, is the true idea
We often play cards
It is a matter of just pride
By a whimsical diversion
It will not be safe
A mild and deprecating air
Our letter must have gone astray
Colored like a fairy tale
I feel bound to add my expression
The silence was deafening
It has been an immense privilege to see you
Buried in the quicksands of ignorance
We thank you very sincerely for your assistance
Appeal to a tardy justice
The city is all in a turmoil; it boils like a pot of lentils
Like troops of ghosts on the dry wind past
Eager-hearted as a boy
I rest my opinion on
The sky was a relentless, changeless blue
Lest I should be accused of quibbling
It is difficult to put a limit
What can be more monstrous than
that spreads insidious, had estrangement come
Like the music in the patter of small feet
These objections only go to show
You will scarcely be surprised
In rising to return my sincere thanks
It is every man's duty to think
Will any gentleman say
The facts are clear and unequivocal
Words as fresh as spring verdure
Might I suggest an alternative?
          [calumniator = makes malicious or knowingly false statements]
I am mainly concerned
Clear as a forest pool
If, unhappily, the day should ever come
If you were asked to point out
A tender tone of remonstrance
As memory scans the past
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
We appreciate the order you were kind enough to send to us
The indefinable air of good-breeding
Should there be objection, I answer
There is nothing to show
Do you remember a concrete instance
A waking dream overshadowed her
That is awesome
His face was gravely authoritative
Cloud-like that island hung afar
Long have I been convinced
Red as the print of a kiss might be
The staple of conversation
I do not want to discourage you
Irresistibly impelled by conscience
Let me persuade you
As a last illustration
I want to thank you for your reply to my question
                                         [tremulous = timid or fearful]
Sugar has more calories than sweeteners
Like a poet hidden
I would have you understand
Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt
Sinister and fatal augury       [augury = sign of something coming; omen]
Stating only the truth, I affirm
But it is otherwise with
Jealously is unjustified
A giant galleon overhead, looked like some misty monster of the deep
A final and irrevocable settlement
A figure full of decision and dignity stood over them
I am your creditor unawares
She did her best to mask her agitation
To my way of conceiving such matters
Like the shadows of the stars in the upheaved sea
One of the most extraordinary incidents
Undertaken under propitious circumstances
I must be excused if I say
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
A graceful nonentity
A sight for the angels to weep over
Thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea
His face showed a pleased bewilderment
His whole frame seemed collapsed and shrinking
She stood her ground with the most perfect dignity
Of course I am delighted
A new marvel of the sky
I ask you, if you please, to rise and give the toast
And silence like a poultice comes to heal the blows of sound
Ransack the vocabulary to make a better story
Our sail like a dew-lit blossom shone
Ruddy as sunrise
A sensation of golden sweetness and delight
He threw out phrases of ill-humor
I can not bound my vision
It will be to your advantage
Sleek and thick and yellow as gold
We always endeavor to please
Thanking you in anticipation
I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe
The sea-song of the trampling waves is as muffled bells
The first practical thought is
The University prides itself on its accomplishments
His sensibilities were offended by this show of emotion
The perpetrator of clumsy witticisms
I am glad to have had this talk with you
Absolutely true it is
The best proof of its timeliness and salutariness
And hence the well-known doctrine
A laugh of jovial significance
Another of these presumptions
I felt a qualm of apprehension
If my opinions are true
It gives us pleasure to recommend
That is quite true, theoretically
Like a game in which the important part is to keep from laughing
That is admirably clear
And now I address myself to my task
The paper was torn badly
In the progress of events
Conceived with imperfect knowledge
Singing lustily as if to exorcise the demon of gloom
There yet remains
Happy and gracious willingness
He harbored his misgivings in silence
This was such rude behavior
Everyone on the watch, like a falcon on its nest
It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world
The melodies of birds and bees
An attitude of passive impartiality
Her strength was destroyed by her agitation
It is a recognized principle
While I feel most keenly the honor
To sum up all that has been said
Bookish precision and professional peculiarity
To stay his tottering constancy
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array he cheers the morn,
Laboring like a giant
Don't buy everything at once
How very surprising
A true similitude of what befalls many men and women
I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise
I partly agree with you
I am glad to be able to think that
Frugal to a degree
Thank you for opening an account with us
I always suffered agonies of shyness
Like the jewels that gleam in baby eyes
As men strip for a race, so must an author strip for the race with time
A shadow of melancholy touched her lithe fancies,
We will be compelled to take the necessary steps
A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air
It must be a cause of delight
As cattle driven by a gadfly
We shall do well to remember
Eyes as deeply dark as are the desert skies
They were involved in a labyrinth of problems
My confidence in you is absolute
Let me add another thing
Blown about by every wind of doctrine
There is a characteristic saying
When I thus profess myself
our pleasant business relations will continue
Conjuring up scenes of incredible beauty and terror
The babble of brooks grown audible
I confess I have had my doubts
Into the very vestibule of death
It is in your power to give
All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions
The sun goes down in flame on the far horizon
An outburst of impassioned eloquence
Writhing with an intensity that burnt like a steady flame
Turn the stove to the highest setting
The engine has overheated
A vague thought, as elusive as the smell of a primrose
My spirit seemed to beat the void, like the bird from out the ark
From the standpoint of expediency and effectiveness
Here and there a solitary volume greeted him
We have sought on this occasion
Altogether monstrous and unnatural
He sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life
Scrupulous and chivalrous loyalty
That is a most interesting idea
It was an unpardonable liberty
I wish to know whether
Her mood was unaccountably frosty
It is a matter of amusement
It is impossible to get there from here
like a wheat-field under a summer breeze
It is the fashion to extol
Love shakes like a windy reed your heart
A whole catalog of disastrous blunders
How intensely interesting!
The air and sky belonged to midsummer
You can't beat the taste of a ripe mango
It is to be expected
Nothing can be further from the truth
It is desirable for us
If, then, I am asked
which resembles the hiss of a serpent
A calmness settled on his spirit
An impervious beckoning motion
That depends on one's point of view
This might be illustrated at length
But surely that is inconsistent
It is manifest
A nimble-witted opponent
I am not ripe to pass sentence
It cased great embarrassment
Rooted in immeasurable error and falsity
A proof of this is
You take a pessimistic view of things
Peace brooded over all
Agitated with violent and contending emotions
Stealthily escaping observation
His eyes blazed like deep forests
It is rather startling
And here were forests ancient as the hills
It's too melancholy
The sycophants of the rich
I am somewhat relieved to know
By this time it will be suspected
Let us get a clear understanding
I love the crisp sparkle of the sea
I hazard nothing in saying
It must be the verdict of history
I am not going to reproach
Yet if you were to ask the question
Soft vibrations of verbal melody, like the sound of a golden bell
Hardened into convictions and resolves
A tone of exaggerated solicitude
We may be permitted to remember
I say it is extremely important
I know it is very presumptuous
Her mouth as sweet as a ripe fig
Calm strength and constancy
I don't make myself clear, I see
I am very far from thinking.
I am thankful for the privilege
I have now made bold to touch upon
Overhung and overspread with ivy
Like ghosts the sentries come and go
And coming nearer to our own day
Wrapt in his odorous and many-colored robe
Constant indulgence of wily stratagem and ambitious craft
Another sign of our times
Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling
It is with great pleasure
It was a high ledge to jump from
If we can be of service to you
Take root in the heart
Glittering like an aigrette of stars
I come at length to
He was dimly mistrustful of it
I attribute it to
Forgive me if I seem disobliging
Brisk directness of speech
Her head dropped into her hands like a storm-broken flower
Trembling like an aspen-leaf
Dissolve like some unsubstantial vision faded
I have to force my imagination
I fancy it's just that
I regret that it is not possible for me
The whole exquisite night was his
You are delightfully frank
It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy
Delicate as nymphs
1
Indeed! How?
My idea of it is quite the reverse
I can scarcely boast that honor
Thanking you for your inquiry
Full of ardent affection and gratitude
Oh, you are very bitter
Immense and careless prodigality
The whispering rumble of the ocean
It gives us an exalted conception
Written in indelible characters upon his heart
Can I persuade you?
Her heart has grown icy as a fountain in the fall
It lends no dazzling tints to fancy
There is no resisting you
We are sending your prize by mail
I said it would be well
It is also possible
Like a whirlwind they went past
The vanity and conceit of insular self-satisfaction
Put in that way it certainly sounds very well
1
Go straight, as if by magic, to the inner meaning
I leave to others to speak
How delightful to meet you
Appealing to the urgent temper of youth
We want to please you in every respect
It is my hope
Now, observe, my drift
In accents embarrassed and hesitating
I especially hail with approval
Like attempting to number the waves on the snore of a limitless sea
I am speaking plainly
This is contrary to all argument
I have now explained to you
A blank absence of interest or sympathy
Now, I have a closing sentence or two
Odorous as all Arabia
There is a good deal of sense in that
But the thing is simply impossible
White as chalk
Aliens were arriving all around us
Embrace with ardor the prospect of serene leisure
Mix the flour and the milk slowly
The chill of forlorn old age
I entirely dissent from the view
I solemnly declare
As stars that shoot along the sky
An appreciable menace
Looking as sulky as the weather itself
A most laudable zeal
Of this briefly
This is a most unexpected pleasure
Occasionally you ought to read
A skeptical suspension of judgment
In one other respect
But if I may even flatter myself
But, then, let us ask ourselves
It is not given to many men
Take one of the most recent cases
Moving in the same dull round, like blind horses in a mill
What is more remarkable
If in the years of the future
She was as brilliant, and as hard too, as electric light
I should be false to my own manhood
The multiplicity of odors competing for your attention
I do not belong to those who
He had the habit of self-engrossed silences
I have in a measure anticipated
Touched with a sort of reverential gratitude
I find it more easy
It is my deliberately formed opinion
I wish I was a pirate
Or to take but one other example
Through endless and labyrinthine sentences
A deep and brooding resentment
This was the language of excessive flattery
It may be useful to trace
Such is the truth
Borne onward by slow-footed time
Like the great thunder sounding
Amid many and pressing avocations
I hear you say to yourselves
He writes uncommonly clever letters
If what has been said is true
Strange capacities and suggestions both of vehemence and pride
We are anxious to make satisfactory adjustment
An addressed envelope is enclosed
I was not slow to accept and believe
Totally detached from all factions
The incarnation of all loveliness
That is most unexpected and distressing
Repugnant alike to reason and conscience
It would be a proud distinction
Thus a great deal may be done
Grim and sullen after the flush of the morning
Her face collapsed as if it were a pricked balloon
Encrusted with pedantry and prejudice    
[pedantry = attention to detail]
His thoughts galloped
His mind leaped gladly to meet new issues and fresh tides of thought
Yonder flimsy crescent, bent like an archer's bow above the snowy summit
One tissue of rashness, folly, ingratitude, and injustice
It is necessary to refer
Inconceivable perversion of reasoning
The compass points to the north
I am willing to comply with your request
The paper napkins were all neatly folded
We would draw your attention to the fact
Let us draw an illustration
Certain it is
One of the most commonly known
I have been told by an eminent authority
We all in equal sincerity profess
Fawning like dumb neglected lap-dogs
Let in confusion like a whirling flood
An indolent surrender to mere sensuous experience
Full of dreams and refinements and intense abstractions
We take the liberty of deviating from your instructions
A golden haze of pensive light
An expression at once confident and appealing
Prodigious and portentous events
His revenge descends perfect, sudden, like a curse from heaven
I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty
A river of shame swept over him
That would be somewhat serious
It is one of the grave problems of the day
I am in sympathy with
Conditions of unspeakable humiliation
And so I may point out
It was as if a door had been opened into a furnace, so the eyes blazed
It is not necessary for our purpose
Never was a weaker defense attempted
The poppy burned like a crimson ember
Amid the homeliest details of daily life
As graceful as a bough
Unknown, like a seed in fallow ground, was the germ of a plan
Are you trying to lose weight
No more than brief palliatives or mitigations
In a tumult of self-approval and towering exultation
I have touched very cursorily
In a secret and surreptitious way
As bright as sunlight on a stream
If you have any cause for dissatisfaction
I do not choose to consume
Give vent to his indignation
I don't know that I can do that
It is an uncommonly fine description
By a happy turn of thinking
2
I wish I knew what you meant by that
Her face was as solemn as a mask
buoyed his high-strung temperament like a tonic
What is there so strange about that?
Certain circumstances make it undesirable
Preening its wings for a skyward flight
Of course I don't want to press you against your will
This is a diet for women by women
In the face of smarting disillusions
Dexterous modes of concealment
All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds
A cloud in the west like a pall creeps upward
The sea slept under a haze of golden winter sun
It is needless before this audience to repeat
Will you bear with me
A little jaded by gastronomical exertions
It may still more probably be said
Kiss-provoking lips
Now, let me stop a moment
The grotesque nightmare of a haunting fear
Here comes the practical matter
Dimmed by the cold touch of unjust suspicion
Her heart pounded in her throat
My love for thee is like the sovereign moon that rules the sea
I seem to hear you say
On the other hand, it is clear
I find no fault with
And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me
What, then, I may be asked
Bright as the coming forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early shower
Under all the circumstances
When I remember the history
He had a gay exuberance of ambition
Wrangle over details like a grasping pawnbroker
There is an eternal controversy
yielded to the persuasive warmth of day
The music of her presence was singing a swift melody in his blood
Jealousy, fierce as the fires
Fastidious correctness of form
The swift and momentous decision could not be reversed
Indeed, can anyone tell me
Those ancestral themes past which so many generations have slept
Would you apply that to everyone?
I am unwillingly bound to add
A wealth of resource that seemed inexhaustible
She showed off her dazzling beauty
We almost shudder when we see
We are pleased to receive your request for information
An honest and unquestioning pride
Like a shadow never to be overtaken
I highly appreciate this mark of confidence
A blind rage like a fire swept over him
I will listen to no protestations
Others may hold other opinions
The same is true in respect of
We may have a deep consciousness
By no means desirable, I think
The shadows of the night seemed to retreat
The voice of Fate, crying like some old Bellman through the world
The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile
Her eyes as stars of twilight fair
The dull derision of the world
His impatient scorn expired
Trusting to receive your best consideration
Let me entreat you to examine
The talk flowed
so white and cold and delicate it was
Like the creaking of doors held stealthily ajar
I congratulate you upon the auspicious character
Will you allow me to present to you
All that I will say now
And the like
Time would not permit me
It is a pleasure for me to answer your inquiry
You have received a false impression
It is all very inexcusable
A man of imperious will             
[imperious = arrogantly domineering]
The grim reality of defeat
The boom of the surf grew ever less sonorous,
It is necessary to take some notice
He was a man of iron will
I personally know that it is so
Day stood distinct in the sky
His agitation increased
The bait proved incredibly successful
Under the sway of arbitrary opinions
To a man of the highest public spirit
A nimble interchange of uninteresting gossip
We take pleasure in enclosing herewith
As far as this objection relates
I will tell you what I think of
slipt forth the slender figure of the Dawn
What is the next step in your argument?
This, then, is the answer
Vast sweep of mellow distances
I content myself with pursuing
Over and above all this
It was a fit and beautiful circumstance
leaving them cold as a winter sky after sunset
Incomparable lucidity and penetrativeness
It seems clear that our letter must have miscarried
This, then, is what I mean by saying
Arrogance and untutored haughtiness
It was a breathless night of suspense
An impersonal and slightly ironic interest
I was at a loss to understand the reason for it
Struck by a sudden curiosity
Put the dishes in the dishwasher now
But I am bound to say
We must constantly direct our purpose
Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor
Nor can it justly be said
1
Soft as the down of the turtle dove
I object strongly to the use
Urgent as the seas
Perished utterly, like a blown-out flame
You are as hard as stone
Ghosts were all around us
I beg you to accept my grateful expression
The sun, like a great dragon, writhes in gold
O
A glacial pang of pain like
The more's the pity
It is rather a pleasant coincidence
The rainbows flashed like fire
These are points for consideration
It is a theme too familiar
Such is the progress
And so I leave these words with you
Green hills pile themselves upon each other's shoulders
Delude many minds into acquiescence
who smile from some dim corner of our memories
The torture of his love and terror crushed him
We are totally at a loss to understand
A sense of meditative content
In quite incredible confusion
How perfectly delightful!
adventitious = Not inherent; added extrinsically
From one point of view we are
His lips seemed to be permanently parted in a good-humored smile
I come to the other assumption
But it may be doubted whether
But how shall I describe my emotions
A misconception which is singularly prevalent
The purging sunlight of clear poetry
Pure as a wild-flower
We can see to some extent
I shall presently show
I hold the maxim no less applicable
The night yawned like a foul wind
I was speaking generally
An addressed envelope is enclosed for your convenience
The same problem has perplexed me
My heart tells me
In reference to your application
It was peculiarly unfortunate
You did not clearly understand what I meant
Anticipation painted the world in rose
An odd little air of penitent self-depreciation

It was said by one who ought to know
As blind as a mole
There was a hot and virulent skirmish
Strange as it may seem
She heard him like one in a dream
The combined dictates of reason and experience
The morning droned along peacefully
Free as the air, from zone to zone I flew
I think he has very noble ideals
A duel of brains
If you desire, our representative will call
I do not consider it necessary
a single diamond on her brow gleamed with imprisoned fire
They were all immersed in secret schemes
There are reasons which make such a course impossible
A flame of scarlet crept across his cheeks
Don't be so dismal, please
It sounds plausible

Questions and answers sounding like a continuous popping of corks
like sea-going winds over pastures
As it happens, your conjecture is right
I trust I may be indulged
The golden gloom of the past and the bright-hued hope of the future
Unfounded and incredible calumnies
Glaring like noontide
I now have the pleasure of presenting to you
What a pretty compliment!
Our services are at your command
One of life's ironical adjustments
Not only so
The sky grew brighter with the imminent day
Straight as a ray of light
The conclusion is irresistible
They were all a little jaded by the rich food
As briefly as I may
Capacity for urbanity and moderation
