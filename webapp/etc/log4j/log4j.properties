# A log4j configuration file that outputs both to System.out and a file named 
#'log4jBabble.log'.

# For the general syntax of property based configuration files see the
# documenation of org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.

# WARNING: Location information can be useful but is very costly in
# terms of computation.

# The root logger uses the appender called A1. 

# The root logger uses the appenders called A1 and A2. Since no level
# is specified, note the empty string between the comma (",") and the
# equals sign ("="), the level of the root logger remains
# untouched. Log4j always initializes the level for the root logger to
# DEBUG. The root logger is the only logger that has a default
# level. By default, all other loggers do not have an assigned level,
# such that they inherit their level instead.

# A1 is set to be ConsoleAppender sending its output to System.out

# A1 uses PatternLayout.

# The conversion pattern consists of date in ISO8601 format, level,
# thread name, logger name truncated to its rightmost two components
# and left justified to 17 characters, location information consisting
# of file name (padded to 13 characters) and line number, nested
# diagnostic context, the and the application supplied message
