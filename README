What is it
--------------
BabbleSMS is a server application that allows for the sending of SMS. 

It is designed to have the look-and-feel of an email account, such that there 
is a shallow learning curve. It can be configured to work with an SMS Gateway 
or Mobile Network Operator of choice.

Messages sent include those to individuals and to groups. Using shorcodes, the 
system can also receive messages.

A sample of it can be seen on the following URL:
